<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A Sublime Elopement</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      IT WAS clearly a runaway match&mdash;never indeed was such a sublime
      elopement. The four horses were coal-black, with blood-red manes and
      tails; and they were shod with rubies. They were harnessed to a basaltic
      car by a single rein of flame. Waving his double-pronged trident in the
      air, the god struck the blue breast of Cyane, and the waters instantly
      parted. In rushed the wild chariot, the pale and insensible Proserpine
      clinging to the breast of her grim lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the depths of the hitherto unfathomed lake the infernal steeds
      held their breathless course. The car jolted against its bed. &lsquo;Save me!&rsquo;
      exclaimed the future Queen of Hades, and she clung with renewed energy to
      the bosom of the dark bridegroom. The earth opened; they entered the
      kingdom of the gnomes. Here Pluto was popular. The lurid populace gave him
      a loud shout. The chariot whirled along through shadowy cities and by dim
      highways, swarming with a busy race of shades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye flowery meads of Enna!&rsquo; exclaimed the terrified Proserpine, &lsquo;shall I
      never view you again? What an execrable climate!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, however, in-door nature is charming,&rsquo; responded Pluto. &lsquo;Tis a great
      nation of manufacturers. You are better, I hope, my Proserpine. The
      passage of the water is never very agreeable, especially to ladies.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And which is our next stage?&rsquo; inquired Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The centre of Earth,&rsquo; replied Pluto. &lsquo;Travelling is so much improved that
      at this rate we shall reach Hades before night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine, &lsquo;is not this night?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not unhappy, my Proserpine?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beloved of my heart, I have given up everything for you! I do not repent,
      but I am thinking of my mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time will pacify the Lady Ceres. What is done cannot be undone. In the
      winter, when a residence among us is even desirable, I should not be
      surprised were she to pay us a visit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her prejudices are so strong,&rsquo; murmured the bride. &lsquo;Oh my Pluto! I hope
      your family will be kind to me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who could be unkind to Proserpine? Ours is a very domestic circle. I can
      assure you that everything is so well ordered among us that I have no
      recollection of a domestic broil.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But marriage is such a revolution in a bachelor&rsquo;s establishment,&rsquo; replied
      Proserpine, despondingly. &lsquo;To tell the truth, too, I am half frightened at
      the thought of the Furies. I have heard that their tempers are so
      violent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They mean well; their feelings are strong, but their hearts are in the
      right place. I flatter myself you will like my nieces, the Parc√¶. They are
      accomplished, and favourites among the men.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! quite irresistible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My heart misgives me. I wish you had at least paid them the compliment of
      apprising them of our marriage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheer up. For myself, I have none but pleasant anticipations. I long to
      be at home once more by my own fireside, and patting my faithful
      Cerberus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I shall like Cerberus; I am fond of dogs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure you will. He is the most faithful creature in the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he very fierce?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if he takes a fancy to you; and who can help taking a fancy to
      Proserpine?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! my Pluto, you are in love.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this Hades?&rsquo; inquired Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      An avenue of colossal bulls, sculptured in basalt and breathing living
      flame, led to gates of brass, adorned with friezes of rubies, representing
      the wars and discomfiture of the Titans. A crimson cloud concealed the
      height of the immense portals, and on either side hovered o&rsquo;er the
      extending walls of the city; a watch-tower or a battlement occasionally
      flashing forth, and forcing their forms through the lurid obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Queen of Hades! welcome to your capital!&rsquo; exclaimed Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monarch rose in his car and whirled a javelin at the gates. There was
      an awful clang, and then a still more terrible growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My faithful Cerberus!&rsquo; exclaimed the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      The portals flew open, and revealed the gigantic form of the celebrated
      watch-dog of Hell. It completely filled their wide expanse. Who but Pluto
      could have viewed without horror that enormous body covered with shaggy
      spikes, those frightful paws clothed with claws of steel, that tail like a
      boa constrictor, those fiery eyes that blazed like the blood-red lamps in
      a pharos, and those three forky tongues, round each of which were entwined
      a vigorous family of green rattlesnakes!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Cerby! Cerby!&rsquo; exclaimed Pluto; &lsquo;my fond and faithful Cerby!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Proserpine screamed as the animal gambolled up to the side of the chariot
      and held out its paw to its master. Then, licking the royal palm with its
      three tongues at once, it renewed its station with a wag of its tail which
      raised such a cloud of dust that for a few minutes nothing was
      perceptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The monster!&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love!&rsquo; exclaimed Pluto, with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The hideous brute!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear!&rsquo; exclaimed Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall never touch me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proserpine!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t touch me with that hand. You never shall touch me, if you allow
      that disgusting animal to lick your hand.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg to inform you that there are few beings of any kind for whom I have
      a greater esteem than that faithful and affectionate beast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! if you like Cerberus better than me, I have no more to say,&rsquo;
      exclaimed the bride, bridling up with indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Proserpine is perverse,&rsquo; replied Pluto; &lsquo;her memory has scarcely done
      me justice.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure you said you liked Cerberus better than anything in the world,&rsquo;
      continued the goddess, with a voice trembling with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said no such thing,&rsquo; replied Pluto, somewhat sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see how it is,&rsquo; replied Proserpine, with a sob; &lsquo;you are tired of me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My beloved!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never expected this.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My child!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it for this I left my mother?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Powers of Hades! How you can say such things!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Broke her heart?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proserpine! Proserpine!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gave up daylight?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the sake of Heaven, then, calm yourself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sacrificed everything?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love! my life! my angel! what is all this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And then to be abused for the sake of a dog!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all the shades of Hell, but this is enough to provoke even immortals.
      What have I done, said, or thought, to justify such treatment?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proserpine!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heigho!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proserpine! Proserpine!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So soon is the veil withdrawn!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dearest, you must be unwell. This journey has been too much for you,&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On our very bridal day to be so treated!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Soul of my existence, don&rsquo;t make me mad. I love you, I adore you; I have
      no hope, no wish, no thought but you. I swear it; I swear it by my sceptre
      and my throne. Speak, speak to your Pluto: tell him all your wish, all
      your desire. What would you have me do?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shoot that horrid beast.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! me!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, you will not? I thought how it would be. I am Proserpine, your
      beloved, adored Proserpine. You have no wish, no hope, no thought but for
      me! I have only to speak, and what I desire will be instantly done! And I
      do speak, I tell you my wish, I express to you my desire, and I am
      instantly refused! And what have I requested? Is it such a mighty favour?
      Is it anything unreasonable? Is there, indeed, in my entreaty anything so
      vastly out of the way? The death of a dog, a disgusting animal, which has
      already shaken my nerves to pieces; and if ever (here she hid her face in
      his breast), if ever that event should occur which both must desire, my
      Pluto, I am sure the very sight of that horrible beast will&mdash;I dare
      not say what it will do.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Pluto looked puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, my Proserpine, it is not in my power to grant your request; for
      Cerberus is immortal, like ourselves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me! miserable!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some arrangement, however, may be made to keep him out of your sight and
      hearing. I can banish him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you, indeed? Oh! banish him, my Pluto! pray banish him! I never shall
      be happy until Cerberus is banished.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do anything you desire; but I confess to you I have some
      misgivings. He is an invaluable watch-dog; and I fear, without his
      superintendence, the guardians of the gate will scarcely do their duty.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! yes: I am sure they will, my Pluto! I will ask them to, I will ask
      them myself, I will request them, as a particular and personal favour to
      myself, to be very careful indeed. And if they do their duty, and I am
      sure they will, they shall be styled, as a reward, &ldquo;Proserpine&rsquo;s Own
      Guards.&rdquo;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A reward, indeed!&rsquo; said the enamoured monarch, as, with a sigh, he signed
      the order for the banishment of Cerberus in the form of his promotion to
      the office of Master of the royal and imperial bloodhounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      The burning waves of Phlegethon assumed a lighter hue. It was morning. It
      was the morning after the arrival of Pluto and his unexpected bride. In
      one of the principal rooms of the palace three beautiful females, clothed
      in cerulean robes spangled with stars, and their heads adorned with golden
      crowns, were at work together. One held a distaff, from which the second
      spun; and the third wielded an enormous pair of adamantine shears, with
      which she perpetually severed the labours of her sisters. Tall were they
      in stature and beautiful in form. Very fair; an expression of haughty
      serenity pervaded their majestic countenances. Their three companions,
      however, though apparently of the same sex, were of a different character.
      If women can ever be ugly, certainly these three ladies might put in a
      valid claim to that epithet. Their complexions were dark and withered, and
      their eyes, though bright, were bloodshot. Scantily clothed in black
      garments, not unstained with gore, their wan and offensive forms were but
      slightly veiled. Their hands were talons; their feet cloven; and serpents
      were wreathed round their brows instead of hair. Their restless and
      agitated carriage afforded also not less striking contrast to the polished
      and aristocratic demeanour of their companions. They paced the chamber
      with hurried and unequal steps, and wild and uncouth gestures; waving,
      with a reckless ferocity, burning torches and whips of scorpions. It is
      hardly necessary to add that these were the Furies, and that the
      conversation which I am about to report was carried on with the Fates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thousand serpents!&rsquo; shrieked Tisiphone. &lsquo;I will never believe it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Racks and flames!&rsquo; squeaked Meg√¶ra. &lsquo;It is impossible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eternal torture!&rsquo; moaned Alecto. &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis a lie.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not Jupiter himself should convince us!&rsquo; the Furies joined in infernal
      chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis nevertheless true,&rsquo; calmly observed the beautiful Clotho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will soon have the honour of being presented to her,&rsquo; added the
      serene Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And whatever we may feel,&rsquo; observed the considerate Atropos, &lsquo;I think, my
      dear girls, you had better restrain yourselves.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what sort of thing is she?&rsquo; inquired Tisiphone, with a shriek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard that she is lovely,&rsquo; answered Clotho. &lsquo;Indeed, it is
      impossible to account for the affair in any other way.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis neither possible to account for nor to justify it,&rsquo; squeaked Meg√¶ra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there, indeed, a Queen in Hell?&rsquo; moaned Alecto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall hold no more drawing-rooms,&rsquo; said Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will never attend hers,&rsquo; said the Furies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must,&rsquo; replied the Fates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt she will give herself airs,&rsquo; shrieked Tisiphone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must remember where she has been brought up, and be considerate,&rsquo;
      replied Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I dare say you three will get on very well with her,&rsquo; squeaked Megasra.
      &lsquo;You always get on well with people.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must remember how very strange things here must appear to her,&rsquo;
      observed Atropos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one can deny that there are some very disagreeable sights,&rsquo; said
      Clotho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in that,&rsquo; replied Tisiphone, looking in the glass, and
      arranging her serpents; &lsquo;and for my part, poor girl, I almost pity her,
      when I think she will have to visit the Harpies.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment four little pages entered the room, who, without exception,
      were the most hideous dwarfs that ever attended upon a monarch. They were
      clothed only in parti-coloured tunics, and their breasts and legs were
      quite bare. From the countenance of the first you would have supposed he
      was in a convulsion; his hands were clenched and his hair stood on end:
      this was Terror! The protruded veins of the second seemed ready to burst,
      and his rubicund visage decidedly proved that he had blood in his head;
      this was Rage! The third was of an ashen colour throughout: this was
      Paleness! And the fourth, with a countenance not without traces of beauty,
      was even more disgusting than his companions from the quantity of horrible
      flies, centipedes, snails, and other noisome, slimy, and indescribable
      monstrosities that were crawling all about his body and feeding on his
      decaying features. The name of this fourth page was Death!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The King and Queen!&rsquo; announced the pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pluto, during the night, had prepared Proserpine for the worst, and had
      endeavoured to persuade her that his love would ever compensate for all
      annoyances. She was in excellent spirits and in very good humour;
      therefore, though she could with difficulty stifle a scream when she
      recognised the Furies, she received the congratulations of the Parc√¶ with
      much cordiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have the pleasure, Proserpine, of presenting you to my family,&rsquo; said
      Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who, I am sure, hope to make Hades agreeable to your Majesty,&rsquo; rejoined
      Clotho. The Furies uttered a suppressed sound between a murmur and a
      growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have ordered the chariot,&rsquo; said Pluto. &lsquo;I propose to take the Queen a
      ride, and show her some of our lions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will, I am sure, be delighted,&rsquo; said Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I long to see Ixion,&rsquo; said Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wretch!&rsquo; shrieked Tisiphone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot help thinking that he has been very unfairly treated,&rsquo; said
      Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; squeaked Meg√¶ra. &lsquo;The ravisher!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay! it is all very well,&rsquo; replied Proserpine; &lsquo;but, for my part, if we
      knew the truth of that affair&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible that your Majesty can speak in such a tone of levity of
      such an offender?&rsquo; shrieked Tisiphone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible?&rsquo; moaned Alecto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you have heard only one side of the question; but for my part,
      knowing as much of Juno as I do&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen of Heaven!&rsquo; observed Atropos, with an intimidating glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen of Fiddlestick!&rsquo; said Proserpine; &lsquo;as great a flirt as ever
      existed, with all her prudish looks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fates and the Furies exchanged glances of astonishment and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For my part,&rsquo; continued Proserpine, &lsquo;I make it a rule to support the
      weaker side, and nothing will ever persuade me that Ixion is not a victim,
      and a pitiable one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! men generally have the best of it in these affairs,&rsquo; said Lachesis,
      with a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Juno ought to be ashamed of herself,&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;Had I been in her
      situation, they should have tied me to a wheel first. At any rate, they
      ought to have punished him in Heaven. I have no idea of those people
      sending every <i>mauvais sujet</i> to Hell.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what shall we do?&rsquo; inquired Pluto, who wished to turn the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we turn out a sinner and hunt him for her Majesty&rsquo;s diversion?&rsquo;
      suggested Tisiphone, flanking her serpents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing of the kind will ever divert me,&rsquo; said Proserpine; &lsquo;for I have no
      hesitation in saying that I do not at all approve of these eternal
      punishments, or, indeed, of any punishment whatever.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The heretic!&rsquo; whispered Tisiphone to Meg√¶ra. Alecto moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It might be more interesting to her Majesty,&rsquo; said Atropos, &lsquo;to witness
      some of those extraordinary instances of predestined misery with which
      Hades abounds. Shall we visit OEdipus?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine. &lsquo;For myself, I willingly confess that
      torture disgusts and Destiny puzzles me.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fates and the Furies all alike started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not understand this riddle of Destiny,&rsquo; continued the young Queen.
      &lsquo;If you, Parc√¶, have predestined that a man should commit a crime, it
      appears to me very unjust that you should afterwards call upon the Furies
      to punish him for its commission.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But man is a free agent,&rsquo; observed Lachesis, in as mild a tone as she
      could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what becomes of Destiny?&rsquo; replied Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Destiny is eternal and irresistible,&rsquo; replied Clotho. &lsquo;All is ordained;
      but man is, nevertheless, master of his own actions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not understand that,&rsquo; said Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not meant to be understood,&rsquo; said Atropos; &lsquo;but you must
      nevertheless believe it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I make it a rule only to believe what I understand,&rsquo; replied Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It appears,&rsquo; said Lachesis, with a blended glance of contempt and
      vengeance, &lsquo;that your Majesty, though a goddess, is an atheist.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for that, anybody may call me just what they please, provided they do
      nothing else. So long as I am not tied to a wheel or whipped with
      scorpions for speaking my mind, I shall be as tolerant of the speech and
      acts of others as I expect them to be tolerant of mine. Come, Pluto, I am
      sure that the chariot must be ready!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, her Majesty took the arm of her spouse, and with a haughty
      curtsey left the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever!&rsquo; shrieked Tisiphone, as the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! never!&rsquo; squeaked Megaera.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never! never!&rsquo; moaned Alecto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She must understand what she believes, must she?&rsquo; said Lachesis, scarcely
      less irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard such nonsense,&rsquo; said Clotho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What next!&rsquo; said Atropos.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Disgusted with torture!&rsquo; exclaimed the Furies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Puzzled with Destiny!&rsquo; said the Fates.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the third morning after the Infernal Marriage; the slumbering
      Proserpine reposed in the arms of the snoring Pluto. There was a loud
      knocking at the chamber-door. Pluto jumped up in the middle of a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My life, what is the matter?&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knocking was repeated and increased. There was also a loud shout of
      &lsquo;treason, murder, and fire!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; exclaimed the god, jumping out of bed and seizing
      his trident. &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your pages, your faithful pages! Treason! treason! For the sake of Hell,
      open the door. Murder, fire, treason!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enter!&rsquo; said Pluto, as the door was unlocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Terror and Rage entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You frightful things, get out of the room!&rsquo; cried Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A moment, my angel!&rsquo; said Pluto, &lsquo;a single moment. Be not alarmed, my
      best love; I pray you be not alarmed. Well, imps, why am I disturbed?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Terror. Rage could not speak, but gnashed his teeth and stamped
      his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O-o-o-h!&rsquo; repeated Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak, cursed imps!&rsquo; cried the enraged Pluto; and he raised his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man! a man!&rsquo; cried Terror. &lsquo;Treason, treason! a man! a man!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What man?&rsquo; said Pluto, in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man, a live man, has entered Hell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t say so?&rsquo; said Proserpine; &lsquo;a man, a live man. Let me see him
      immediately.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; said Pluto; &lsquo;what is he doing?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is here, there, and everywhere! asking for your wife, and singing like
      anything.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proserpine!&rsquo; said Pluto, reproachfully; but, to do the god justice, he
      was more astounded than jealous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I shall be delighted to see him; it is so long since I have
      seen a live man,&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;Who can he be? A man, and a live man!
      How delightful! It must be a messenger from my mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how came he here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! how came he here?&rsquo; echoed Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No time must be lost!&rsquo; exclaimed Pluto, scrambling on his robe. &lsquo;Seize
      him, and bring him into the council chamber. My charming Proserpine,
      excuse me for a moment.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all; I will accompany you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my love, my sweetest, my own, this is business; these are affairs of
      state. The council chamber is not a place for you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why not?&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;I have no idea of ever leaving you for a
      moment. Why not for me as well as for the Fates and the Furies? Am I not
      Queen? I have no idea of such nonsense!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love!&rsquo; said the deprecating husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t go without me,&rsquo; said the imperious wife, seizing his robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must,&rsquo; said Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you shall never return,&rsquo; said Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enchantress! be reasonable.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never was, and I never will be,&rsquo; replied the Goddess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treason! treason!&rsquo; screamed Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My love, I must go!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pluto,&rsquo; said Proserpine, &lsquo;understand me once for all, I will not be
      contradicted.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Rage stamped his foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proserpine, understand me once for all, it is impossible,&rsquo; said the God,
      frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My Pluto!&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;Is it my Pluto who speaks thus sternly to me?
      Is it he who, but an hour ago, a short hour ago, died upon my bosom in
      transports and stifled me with kisses! Unhappy woman! wretched, miserable
      Proserpine! Oh! my mother! my kind, my affectionate mother! Have I
      disobeyed you for this! For this have I deserted you! For this have I
      broken your beloved heart!&rsquo; She buried her face in the crimson
      counterpane, and bedewed its gorgeous embroidery with her fast-flowing
      tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treason!&rsquo; shouted Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; exclaimed the hysterical Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; cried Pluto. &lsquo;Proserpine, my adored, my beloved, my
      enchanting Proserpine, compose yourself; for my sake, compose yourself. I
      love you! I adore you! You know it! oh! indeed you know it!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hysterics increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Treason! treason!&rsquo; shouted Terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your infernal tongue,&rsquo; said Pluto. &lsquo;What do I care for treason when
      the Queen is in this state?&rsquo; He knelt by the bedside, and tried to stop
      her mouth with kisses, and ever and anon whispered his passion. &lsquo;My
      Proserpine, I beseech you to be calm; I will do anything you like. Come,
      come, then, to the council!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The hysterics ceased; the Queen clasped him in her arms and rewarded him
      with a thousand embraces. Then, jumping up, she bathed her swollen eyes
      with a beautiful cosmetic that she and her maidens had distilled from the
      flowers of Enna; and, wrapping herself up in her shawl, descended with his
      Majesty, who was quite as much puzzled about the cause of this disturbance
      as when he was first roused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing an immense covered bridge, the origin of the Bridge of Sighs at
      Venice, over the royal gardens, which consisted entirely of cypress, the
      royal pair, preceded by the pages-in-waiting, entered the council chamber.
      The council was already assembled. On either side of a throne of sulphur,
      from which issued the four infernal rivers of Lethe, Phlegethon, Cocytus,
      and Acheron, were ranged the Eumenides and Parc√¶. Lachesis and her sisters
      turned up their noses when they observed Proserpine; but the Eumenides
      could not stifle their fury, in spite of the hints of their more subdued
      but not less malignant companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this?&rsquo; inquired Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The constitution is in danger,&rsquo; said the Parc√¶ in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Both in church and state,&rsquo; added the Furies. &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis a case of treason and
      blasphemy;&rsquo; and they waved their torches and shook their whips with
      delighted anticipation of their use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Detail the circumstances,&rsquo; said Pluto, waving his hand majestically to
      Lachesis, in whose good sense he had great confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man, a living man, has entered your kingdom, unknown and unnoticed,&rsquo;
      said Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By my sceptre, is it true?&rsquo; said the astonished King. &lsquo;Is he seized?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The extraordinary mortal baffles our efforts,&rsquo; said Lachesis. &lsquo;He bears
      with him a lyre, the charmed gift of Apollo, and so seducing are his
      strains that in vain our guards advance to arrest his course; they
      immediately begin dancing, and he easily eludes their efforts. The general
      confusion is indescribable. All business is at a standstill: Ixion rests
      upon his wheel; old Sisyphus sits down on his mountain, and his stone has
      fallen with a terrible plash into Acheron. In short, unless we are
      energetic, we are on the eve of a revolution.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His purpose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seeks yourself and&mdash;her Majesty,&rsquo; added Lachesis, with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Immediately announce that we will receive him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected guest was not slow in acknowledging the royal summons. A
      hasty treaty was drawn up; he was to enter the palace unmolested, on
      condition that he ceased playing his lyre. The Fates and the Furies
      exchanged significant glances as his approach was announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, the live man, who had committed the unprecedented crime of
      entering Hell without a licence, and the previous deposit of his soul as
      security for the good behaviour of his body, stood before the surprised
      and indignant Court of Hades. Tall and graceful in stature, and crowned
      with laurels, Proserpine was glad to observe that the man, who was
      evidently famous, was also good-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thy purpose, mortal?&rsquo; inquired Pluto, with awful majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mercy!&rsquo; answered the stranger in a voice of exquisite melody, and
      sufficiently embarrassed to render him interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is mercy?&rsquo; inquired the Fates and the Furies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak, stranger, without fear,&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;Thy name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Orpheus; but a few days back the too happy husband of the enchanting
      Eurydice. Alas! dread King, and thou too, beautiful and benignant partner
      of his throne, I won her by my lyre, and by my lyre I would redeem her.
      Know, then, that in the very glow of our gratified passion a serpent crept
      under the flowers on which we reposed, and by a fatal sting summoned my
      adored to the shades. Why did it not also summon me? I will not say why
      should I not have been the victim in her stead; for I feel too keenly that
      the doom of Eurydice would not have been less forlorn, had she been the
      wretched being who had been spared to life. O King! they whispered on
      earth that thou too hadst yielded thy heart to the charms of love. Pluto,
      they whispered, is no longer stern: Pluto also feels the all-subduing
      influence of beauty. Dread monarch, by the self-same passion that rages in
      our breasts alike, I implore thy mercy. Thou hast risen from the couch of
      love, the arm of thy adored has pressed upon thy heart, her honied lips
      have clung with rapture to thine, still echo in thy ears all the
      enchanting phrases of her idolatry. Then, by the memory of these, by all
      the higher and ineffable joys to which these lead, King of Hades, spare
      me, oh! spare me, Eurydice!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Proserpine threw her arms round the neck of her husband, and, hiding her
      face in his breast, wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rash mortal, you demand that which is not in the power of Pluto to
      concede,&rsquo; said Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have heard much of treason since my entrance into Hades,&rsquo; replied
      Orpheus, &lsquo;and this sounds like it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mortal!&rsquo; exclaimed Clotho, with contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor is it in your power to return, sir,&rsquo; said Tisiphone, shaking her
      whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have accounts to settle with you,&rsquo; said Meg√¶ra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Spare her, spare her,&rsquo; murmured Proserpine to her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;King of Hades!&rsquo; said Lachesis, with much dignity, &lsquo;I hold a responsible
      office in your realm, and I claim the constitutional privilege of your
      attention. I protest against the undue influence of the Queen. She is a
      power unknown in our constitution, and an irresponsible agent that I will
      not recognise. Let her go back to the drawing-room, where all will bow to
      her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hag!&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine. &lsquo;King of Hades, I, too, can appeal to you.
      Have I accepted your crown to be insulted by your subjects?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A subject, may it please your Majesty, who has duties as strictly defined
      by our infernal constitution as those of your royal spouse; duties, too,
      which, let me tell you, madam, I and <i>my order</i> are resolved to
      perform.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gods of Olympus!&rsquo; cried Proserpine. &lsquo;Is this to be a Queen?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before we proceed further in this discussion,&rsquo; said Lachesis, &lsquo;I must
      move an inquiry into the conduct of his Excellency the Governor of the
      Gates. I move, then, that Cerberus be summoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pluto started, and the blood rose to his dark cheek. &lsquo;I have not yet had
      an opportunity of mentioning,&rsquo; said his Majesty, in a low tone, and with
      an air of considerable confusion, &lsquo;that I have thought fit, as a reward
      for his past services, to promote Cerberus to the office of the Master of
      the Hounds. He therefore is no longer responsible.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O-h!&rsquo; shrieked the Furies, as they elevated their hideous eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The constitution has invested your Majesty with a power in the
      appointment of your Officers of State which your Majesty has undoubtedly a
      right to exercise,&rsquo; said Lachesis. &lsquo;What degree of discretion it
      anticipated in the exercise, it is now unnecessary, and would be extremely
      disagreeable, to discuss. I shall not venture to inquire by what new
      influence your Majesty has been guided in the present instance. The
      consequence of your Majesty&rsquo;s conduct is obvious, in the very difficult
      situation in which your realm is now placed. For myself and my colleagues,
      I have only to observe that we decline, under this crisis, any further
      responsibility; and the distaff and the shears are at your Majesty&rsquo;s
      service the moment your Majesty may find convenient successors to the
      present holders. As a last favour, in addition to the many we are proud to
      remember we have received from your Majesty, we entreat that we may be
      relieved from their burthen as quickly as possible.&rsquo; (Loud cheers from the
      Eumenides.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We had better recall Cerberus,&rsquo; said Pluto, alarmed, &lsquo;and send this
      mortal about his business.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not without Eurydice. Oh! not without Eurydice,&rsquo; said the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence, Proserpine!&rsquo; said Pluto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it please your Majesty,&rsquo; said Lachesis, &lsquo;I am doubtful whether we
      have the power of expelling anyone from Hades. It is not less the law that
      a mortal cannot remain here; and it is too notorious for me to mention the
      fact that none here have the power of inflicting death.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what use are all your laws,&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine, &lsquo;if they are only
      to perplex us? As there are no statutes to guide us, it is obvious that
      the King&rsquo;s will is supreme. Let Orpheus depart, then, with his bride.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The latter suggestion is clearly illegal,&rsquo; said Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lachesis, and ye, her sisters,&rsquo; said Proserpine, &lsquo;forget, I beseech you,
      any warm words that may have passed between us, and, as a personal favour
      to one who would willingly be your friend, release Eurydice. What! you
      shake your heads! Nay; of what importance can be a single miserable shade,
      and one, too, summoned so cruelly before her time, in these
      thickly-peopled regions?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis the principle,&rsquo; said Lachesis; &lsquo;&lsquo;tis the principle. Concession is
      ever fatal, however slight. Grant this demand; others, and greater, will
      quickly follow. Mercy becomes a precedent, and the realm is ruined.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ruined!&rsquo; echoed the Furies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I say <i>preserved!</i>&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine with energy. &lsquo;The State
      is in confusion, and you yourselves confess that you know not how to
      remedy it. Unable to suggest a course, follow mine. I am the advocate of
      mercy; I am the advocate of concession; and, as you despise all higher
      impulses, I meet you on your own grounds. I am their advocate for the sake
      of policy, of expediency.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said the Fates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; shrieked the Furies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, then, will you do with Orpheus?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Parc√¶ shook their heads; even the Eumenides were silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you are unable to carry on the King&rsquo;s government; for Orpheus must
      be disposed of; all agree to that. Pluto, reject these counsellors, at
      once insulting and incapable. Give me the distaff and the fatal shears. At
      once form a new Cabinet; and let the release of Orpheus and Eurydice be
      the basis of their policy.&rsquo; She threw her arms round his neck and
      whispered in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pluto was perplexed; his confidence in the Parcae was shaken. A difficulty
      had occurred with which they could not cope. It was true the difficulty
      had been occasioned by a departure from their own exclusive and
      restrictive policy. It was clear that the gates of Hell ought never to
      have been opened to the stranger; but opened they had been. Forced to
      decide, he decided on the side of <i>expediency</i>, and signed a decree
      for the departure of Orpheus and Eurydice. The Parcas immediately resigned
      their posts, and the Furies walked off in a huff. Thus, on the third day
      of the Infernal Marriage, Pluto found that he had quarrelled with all his
      family, and that his ancient administration was broken up. The King was
      without a friend, and Hell was without a Government!

    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>A Visit to Elysium</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      LET us change the scene from Hades to Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      A chariot drawn by dragons hovered over that superb palace whose sparkling
      steps of lapislazuli were once pressed by the daring foot of Ixion. It
      descended into the beautiful gardens, and Ceres, stepping out, sought the
      presence of Jove.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father of gods and men,&rsquo; said the majestic mother of Proserpine, &lsquo;listen
      to a distracted parent! All my hopes were centred in my daughter, the
      daughter of whom you have deprived me. Is it for this that I endured the
      pangs of childbirth? Is it for this that I suckled her on this miserable
      bosom? Is it for this that I tended her girlish innocence, watched with
      vigilant fondness the development of her youthful mind, and cultured with
      a thousand graces and accomplishments her gifted and unrivalled promise?
      to lose her for ever!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beloved Bona Dea,&rsquo; replied Jove, &lsquo;calm yourself!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jupiter, you forget that I am a mother.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the recollection of that happy circumstance that alone should make
      you satisfied.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mock me? Where is my daughter?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the very situation you should desire. In her destiny all is fulfilled
      which the most affectionate mother could hope. What was the object of all
      your care and all her accomplishments? a good parti; and she has found
      one.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To reign in Hell!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.&rdquo; What! would you have had
      her a cup-bearer, like Hebe, or a messenger, like Hermes? Was the daughter
      of Jove and Ceres to be destined to a mere place in our household! Lady!
      she is the object of envy to half the goddesses. Bating our own bed, which
      she could not share, what lot more distinguished than hers? Recollect that
      goddesses, who desire a becoming match, have a very limited circle to
      elect from. Even Venus was obliged to put up with Vulcan. It will not do
      to be too nice. Thank your stars that she is not an old maid like
      Minerva.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Mars? he loved her.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A young officer only with his half-pay, however good his connections, is
      surely not a proper mate for our daughter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Apollo?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no opinion of a literary son-in-law. These scribblers are at
      present the fashion, and are very well to ask to dinner; but I confess a
      more intimate connection with them is not at all to my taste.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meet Apollo everywhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The truth is, he is courted because every one is afraid of him. He is the
      editor of a daily journal, and under the pretence of throwing light upon
      every subject, brings a great many disagreeable things into notice, which
      is excessively inconvenient. Nobody likes to be paragraphed; and for my
      part I should only be too happy to extinguish the Sun and every other
      newspaper were it only in my power.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Pluto is so old, and so ugly, and, all agree, so ill-tempered.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has a splendid income, a magnificent estate; his settlements are
      worthy of his means. This ought to satisfy a mother; and his political
      influence is necessary to me, and this satisfies a father.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the heart&mdash;&mdash;-&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As for that, she fancies she loves him; and whether she do or not, these
      feelings, we know, never last. Rest assured, my dear Ceres, that our girl
      has made a brilliant match, in spite of the gloomy atmosphere in which she
      has to reside.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must end in misery. I know Proserpine. I confess it with tears, she is
      a spoiled child.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This may occasion Pluto many uneasy moments; but that is nothing to you
      or me. Between ourselves, I shall not be at all surprised if she plague
      his life out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can she consort with the Fates? How is it possible for her to
      associate with the Furies? She, who is used to the gayest and most amiable
      society in the world? Indeed, indeed, &lsquo;tis an ill-assorted union!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are united, however; and, take my word for it, my dear madam, that
      you had better leave Pluto alone. The interference of a mother-in-law is
      proverbially never very felicitous.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime affairs went on swimmingly in Tartarus. The obstinate
      Fates and the sulky Furies were unwittingly the cause of universal
      satisfaction. Everyone enjoyed himself, and enjoyment when it is
      unexpected is doubly satisfactory. Tantalus, Sisyphus, and Ixion, for the
      first time during their punishment, had an opportunity for a little
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long live our reforming Queen,&rsquo; said the ex-king of Lydia. &lsquo;You cannot
      conceive, my dear companions, anything more delightful than this
      long-coveted draught of cold water; its flavour far surpasses the memory
      of my choicest wines. And as for this delicious fruit, one must live in a
      hot climate, like our present one, sufficiently to appreciate its
      refreshing gust. I would, my dear friends, you could only share my
      banquet.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty is very kind,&rsquo; replied Sisyphus, &lsquo;but it seems to me that
      nothing in the world will ever induce me again to move. One must have
      toiled for ages to comprehend the rapturous sense of repose that now
      pervades my exhausted frame. Is it possible that that damned stone can
      really have disappeared?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say truly,&rsquo; said Ixion, &lsquo;the couches of Olympus cannot compare with
      this resting wheel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Noble Sisyphus,&rsquo; rejoined Tantalus, &lsquo;we are both of us acquainted with
      the cause of our companion&rsquo;s presence in those infernal regions, since his
      daring exploit has had the good fortune of being celebrated by one of the
      fashionable authors of this part of the world.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have never had time to read his work,&rsquo; interrupted Ixion. &lsquo;What sort of
      a fellow is he?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of the most conceited dogs that I ever met with,&rsquo; replied the King.
      &lsquo;He thinks he is a great genius, and perhaps he has some little talent for
      the extravagant.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are there any critics in Hell?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Myriads. They abound about the marshes of Cocytus, where they croak
      furiously. They are all to a man against our author.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That speaks more to his credit than his own self-opinion,&rsquo; rejoined
      Ixion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>A nous moutons!</i>&rsquo; exclaimed Tantalus; &lsquo;I was about to observe that
      I am curious to learn for what reason our friend Sisyphus was doomed to
      his late terrible exertions.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the simplest in the world,&rsquo; replied the object of the inquiry;
      &lsquo;because I was not a hypocrite. No one ever led a pleasanter life than
      myself, and no one was more popular in society. I was considered, as they
      phrased it, the most long-headed prince of my time, and was in truth a
      finished man of the world. I had not an acquaintance whom I had not taken
      in, and gods and men alike favoured me. In an unlucky moment, however, I
      offended the infernal deities, and it was then suddenly discovered that I
      was the most abandoned character of my age. You know the rest.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem,&rsquo; exclaimed Tantalus, &lsquo;to be relating my own history; for I
      myself led a reckless career with impunity, until some of the gods did me
      the honour of dining with me, and were dissatisfied with the repast. I am
      convinced myself that, provided a man frequent the temples, and observe
      with strictness the sacred festivals, such is the force of public opinion,
      that there is no crime which he may not commit without hazard.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long live hypocrisy!&rsquo; exclaimed Ixion. &lsquo;It is not my forte. But if I
      began life anew, I would be more observant in my sacrifices.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who could have anticipated this wonderful revolution!&rsquo; exclaimed
      Sisyphus, stretching himself. &lsquo;I wonder what will occur next! Perhaps we
      shall be all released.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say truly,&rsquo; said Ixion. &lsquo;I am grateful to our reforming Queen; but I
      have no idea of stopping here. This cursed wheel indeed no longer whirls;
      but I confess my expectations will be much disappointed if I cannot free
      myself from these adamantine bonds that fix me to its orb.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And one cannot drink water for ever,&rsquo; said Tantalus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&mdash;n all half measures,&rsquo; said Ixion. &lsquo;We must proceed in this system
      of amelioration.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without doubt,&rsquo; responded his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Queen must have a party,&rsquo; continued the audacious lover of Juno. &lsquo;The
      Fates and the Furies never can be conciliated. It is evident to me that
      she must fall unless she unbinds these chains of mine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And grants me full liberty of egress and regress,&rsquo; exclaimed Sisyphus.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And me a bottle of the finest golden wine of Lydia,&rsquo; said Tantalus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infernal honeymoon was over. A cloud appeared in the hitherto serene
      heaven of the royal lovers. Proserpine became unwell. A mysterious languor
      pervaded her frame; her accustomed hilarity deserted her. She gave up her
      daily rides; she never quitted the palace, scarcely her chamber. All day
      long she remained lying on a sofa, and whenever Pluto endeavoured to
      console her she went into hysterics. His Majesty was quite miserable, and
      the Fates and the Furies began to hold up their heads. The two court
      physicians could throw no light upon the complaint, which baffled all
      their remedies. These, indeed, were not numerous, for the two physicians
      possessed each only one idea. With one every complaint was nervous; the
      other traced everything to the liver. The name of the first was Dr.
      Blue-Devil; and of the other Dr. Blue-Pill. They were most eminent men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her Majesty, getting worse every day, Pluto, in despair, determined to
      send for √Üsculapius. It was a long way to send for a physician; but then
      he was the most fashionable one in the world. He cared not how far he
      travelled to visit a patient, because he was paid by the mile; and it was
      calculated that his fee for quitting earth, and attending the Queen of
      Hell, would allow him to leave off business.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a wise physician was √Üsculapius! Physic was his abhorrence. He never
      was known, in the whole course of his practice, ever to have prescribed a
      single drug. He was a handsome man, with a flowing beard curiously
      perfumed, and a robe of the choicest purple. He twirled a cane of agate,
      round which was twined a serpent of precious stones, the gift of Juno, and
      he rode in a chariot drawn by horses of the Sun. When he visited
      Proserpine, he neither examined her tongue nor felt her pulse, but gave
      her an account of a fancy ball which he had attended the last evening he
      passed on <i>terra firma</i>. His details were so interesting that the
      Queen soon felt better. The next day he renewed his visit, and gave her an
      account of a new singer that had appeared at Ephesus. The effect of this
      recital was so satisfactory, that a bulletin in the evening announced that
      the Queen was convalescent. The third day √Üsculapius took his departure,
      having previously enjoined change of scene for her Majesty, and a visit to
      the Elysian Fields!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heh, heh!&rsquo; shrieked Tisiphone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hah, hah!&rsquo; squeaked Meg√¶ra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hoh, hoh!&rsquo; moaned Alecto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now or never,&rsquo; said the infernal sisters. &lsquo;There is a decided reaction.
      The moment she embarks, unquestionably we will flare up.&rsquo; So they ran off
      to the Fates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must be prudent,&rsquo; said Clotho.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our time is not come,&rsquo; remarked Lachesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish the reaction was more decided,&rsquo; said Atropos; &lsquo;but it is a great
      thing that they are going to be parted, for the King must remain.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The opposition party, although aiming at the same result, was therefore
      evidently divided as to the means by which it was to be obtained. The
      sanguine Furies were for fighting it out at once, and talked bravely of
      the strong conservative spirit only dormant in Tartarus. Even the Radicals
      themselves are dissatisfied: Tantalus is no longer contented with water,
      or Ixion with repose. But the circumspect Fates felt that a false step at
      present could never be regained. They talked, therefore, of watching
      events. Both divisions, however, agreed that the royal embarkation was to
      be the signal for renewed intrigues and renovated exertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Proserpine was assured that she must be parted for a time from Pluto,
      she was inconsolable. They passed the night in sorrowful embraces. She
      vowed that she could not live a day without him, and that she certainly
      should die before she reached the first post. The mighty heart of the King
      of Hades was torn to pieces with contending emotions. In the agony of his
      overwhelming passion the security of his realm seemed of secondary
      importance compared with the happiness of his wife. Fear and hatred of the
      Parc√¶ and the Eumenides equalled, however, in the breast of Proserpine,
      her affection for her husband. The consciousness that his absence would be
      a signal for a revolution, and that the crown of Tartarus might be lost to
      her expected offspring, animated her with a spirit of heroism. She
      reconciled herself to the terrible separation, on condition that Pluto
      wrote to her every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Adieu! my best, my only beloved!&rsquo; ejaculated the unhappy Queen; &lsquo;do not
      forget me for a moment; and let nothing in the world induce you to speak
      to any of those horrid people. I know them; I know exactly what they will
      be at: the moment I am gone they will commence their intrigues for the
      restoration of the reign of doom and torture. Do not listen to them, my
      Pluto. Sooner than have recourse to them, seek assistance from their
      former victims.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Calm yourself, my Proserpine. Anticipate no evil. I shall be firm; do not
      doubt me. I will cling with tenacity to that <i>juste milieu</i> under
      which we have hitherto so eminently prospered. Neither the Parc√¶ and the
      Eumenides, nor Ixion and his friends, shall advance a point. I will keep
      each faction in awe by the bugbear of the other&rsquo;s supremacy. Trust me, I
      am a profound politician.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      It was determined that the progress of Proserpine to the Elysian Fields
      should be celebrated with a pomp and magnificence becoming her exalted
      station. The day of her departure was proclaimed as a high festival in
      Hell. Tiresias, absent on a secret mission, had been summoned back by
      Pluto, and appointed to attend her Majesty during her journey and her
      visit, for Pluto had the greatest confidence in his discretion. Besides,
      as her Majesty had not at present the advantage of any female society, it
      was necessary that she should be amused; and Tiresias, though old, ugly,
      and blind, was a wit as well as a philosopher, the most distinguished
      diplomatist of his age, and considered the best company in Hades.
    </p>
    <p>
      An immense crowd was assembled round the gates of the palace on the morn
      of the royal departure. With what anxious curiosity did they watch those
      huge brazen portals! Every precaution was taken for the accommodation of
      the public. The streets were lined with troops of extraordinary stature,
      whose nodding plumes prevented the multitude from catching a glimpse of
      anything that passed, and who cracked the skulls of the populace with
      their scimitars if they attempted in the slightest degree to break the
      line. Moreover, there were seats erected which any one might occupy at a
      reasonable rate; but the lord steward, who had the disposal of the
      tickets, purchased them all for himself, and then resold them to his
      fellow-subjects at an enormous price.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the hinges of the gigantic portals gave an ominous creak, and,
      amid the huzzas of men and the shrieks of women, the procession commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came the infernal band. It consisted of five hundred performers,
      mounted on different animals. Never was such a melodious blast. Fifty
      trumpeters, mounted on zebras of all possible stripes and tints, and
      working away at huge ramshorns with their cheeks like pumpkins. Then there
      were bassoons mounted on bears, clarionets on camelopards, oboes on
      unicorns, and troops of musicians on elephants, playing on real serpents,
      whose prismatic bodies indulged in the most extraordinary convolutions
      imaginable, and whose arrowy tongues glittered with superb agitation at
      the exquisite sounds which they unintentionally delivered. Animals there
      were, too, now unknown and forgotten; but I must not forget the fellow who
      beat the kettledrums, mounted on an enormous mammoth, and the din of whose
      reverberating blows would have deadened the thunder of Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      This enchanting harmony preceded the regiment of Proserpine&rsquo;s own guards,
      glowing in adamantine armour and mounted on coal-black steeds. Their
      helmets were quite awful, and surmounted by plumes plucked from the wings
      of the Harpies, which were alone enough to terrify an earthly host. It was
      droll to observe this troop of gigantic heroes commanded by infants, who,
      however, were arrayed in a similar costume, though, of course, on a
      smaller scale. But such was the admirable discipline of the infernal
      forces, that, though lions to their enemies, they were Iambs to their
      friends; and on the present occasion their colonel was carried in a
      cradle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After these came twelve most worshipful baboons, in most venerable wigs.
      They were clothed with scarlet robes lined with ermine, and ornamented
      with gold chains, and mounted on the most obstinate and inflexible mules
      in Tartarus. These were the judges. Each was provided with a pannier of
      choice cobnuts, which he cracked with great gravity, throwing the shells
      to the multitude, an infernal ceremony, there held emblematic of their
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Chancellor came next in a grand car. Although his wig was even
      longer than those of his fellow functionaries, his manners and the rest of
      his costume afforded a strange contrast to them. Apparently never was such
      a droll, lively fellow. His dress was something between that of Harlequin
      and Scaramouch. He amused himself by keeping in the air four brazen balls
      at the same time, swallowing daggers, spitting fire, turning sugar into
      salt, and eating yards of pink ribbon, which, after being well digested,
      re-appeared through his nose. It is unnecessary to add, after this, that
      he was the most popular Lord Chancellor that had ever held the seals, and
      was received with loud and enthusiastic cheers, which apparently repaid
      him for all his exertions. Notwithstanding his numerous and curious
      occupations, I should not omit to add that his Lordship, nevertheless,
      found time to lead by the nose a most meek and milk-white jackass that
      immediately followed him, and which, in spite of the remarkable length of
      its ears, seemed the object of great veneration. There was evidently some
      mystery about this animal difficult to penetrate. Among other
      characteristics, it was said, at different seasons, to be distinguished by
      different titles; for sometimes it was styled &lsquo;The Public,&rsquo; at others
      &lsquo;Opinion,&rsquo; and occasionally was saluted as the &lsquo;King&rsquo;s Conscience.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came a numerous company of Priests, in flowing and funereal robes,
      bearing banners, inscribed with the various titles of their Queen; on some
      was inscribed Hecate, on others Juno Inferna, on others Theogamia, Libera
      on some, on others Cotytto. Those that bore banners were crowned with
      wreaths of narcissus, and mounted on bulls blacker than night, and of a
      severe and melancholy aspect. Others walked by their side, bearing
      branches of cypress.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here I must stop to notice a droll characteristic of the priestly
      economy of Hades. To be a good pedestrian was considered an essential
      virtue of an infernal clergyman; but to be mounted on a black bull was the
      highest distinction of the craft. It followed, therefore, that,
      originally, promotion to such a seat was the natural reward of any priest
      who had distinguished himself in the humbler career of a good walker; but
      in process of time, as even infernal as well as human institutions are
      alike liable to corruption, the black bulls became too often occupied by
      the halt and the crippled, the feeble and the paralytic, who used their
      influence at Court to become thus exempted from the performance of the
      severer duties of which they were incapable. This violation of the
      priestly constitution excited at first great murmurs among the abler but
      less influential brethren. But the murmurs of the weak prove only the
      tyranny of the strong; and so completely in the course of time do
      institutions depart from their original character, that the imbecile
      riders of the black bulls now avowedly defended their position on the very
      grounds which originally should have unseated them, and openly maintained
      that it was very evident that the stout were intended to walk, and the
      feeble to be carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests were followed by fifty dark chariots, drawn by blue satyrs.
      Herein was the wardrobe of the Queen, and her Majesty&rsquo;s cooks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiresias came next, in a basalt chariot, yoked to royal steeds. He was
      attended by Manto, who shared his confidence, and who, some said, was his
      daughter, and others his niece. Venerable seer! Who could behold that
      flowing beard, and the thin grey hairs of that lofty and wrinkled brow,
      without being filled with sensations of awe and affection? A smile of
      bland benignity played upon his passionless and reverend countenance.
      Fortunate the monarch who is blessed with such a counsellor! Who could
      have supposed that all this time Tiresias was concocting an epigram on
      Pluto!
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen! The Queen!
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon a superb throne, placed upon an immense car, and drawn by twelve
      coal-black steeds, four abreast, reposed the royal daughter of Ceres. Her
      rich dark hair was braided off her high pale forehead, and fell in
      voluptuous clusters over her back. A tiara sculptured out of a single
      brilliant, and which darted a flash like lightning on the surrounding
      multitude, was placed somewhat negligently on the right side of her head;
      but no jewels broke the entrancing swell of her swan-like neck, or were
      dimmed by the lustre of her ravishing arms. How fair was the Queen of
      Hell! How thrilling the solemn lustre of her violet eye! A robe, purple as
      the last hour of twilight, encompassed her transcendent form, studded with
      golden stars!
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the dim hot streets of Tartarus moved the royal procession, until
      it reached the first winding of the river Styx. Here an immense assemblage
      of yachts and barges, dressed out with the infernal colours, denoted the
      appointed spot of the royal embarkation. Tiresias, dismounting from his
      chariot, and leaning on Manto, now approached her Majesty, and requesting
      her royal commands, recommended her to lose no time in getting on board.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When your Majesty is once on the Styx,&rsquo; observed the wily seer, &lsquo;it may
      be somewhat difficult to recall you to Hades; but I know very little of
      Clotho, may it please your Majesty, if she have not already commenced her
      intrigues in Tartarus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You alarm me!&rsquo; said Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was not my intention. Caution is not fear.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you think that Pluto&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May it please your Majesty, I make it a rule never to think. I know too
      much.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us embark immediately!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly; I would recommend your Majesty to get off at once. Myself and
      Manto will accompany you, and the cooks. If an order arrive to stay our
      departure, we can then send back the priests.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You counsel well, Tiresias. I wish you had not been absent on my arrival.
      Affairs might have gone better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all. Had I been in Hell, your enemies would have been more wary.
      Your Majesty&rsquo;s excellent spirit carried you through triumphantly; but it
      will not do so twice. You turned them out, and I must keep them out.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So be it, my dear friend.&rsquo; Thus saying, the Queen descended her throne,
      and leaving the rest of her retinue to follow with all possible despatch,
      embarked on board the infernal yacht, with Tiresias, Manto, the chief
      cook, and some chosen attendants, and bid adieu for the first time, not
      without agitation, to the gloomy banks of Tartarus.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breeze was favourable, and, animated by the exhortations of Tiresias,
      the crew exerted themselves to the utmost. The barque swiftly scudded over
      the dark waters. The river was of great breadth, and in this dim region
      the crew were soon out of sight of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been in Elysium?&rsquo; inquired Proserpine of Tiresias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been everywhere,&rsquo; replied the seer, &lsquo;and though I am blind have
      managed to see a great deal more than my fellows.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have often heard of you,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;and I confess that yours is
      a career which has much interested me. What vicissitudes in affairs have
      you not witnessed! And yet you have somehow or other contrived to make
      your way through all the storms in which others have sunk, and are now, as
      you always have been, in an exalted position. What can be your magic? I
      would that you would initiate me. I know that you are a prophet, and that
      even the gods consult you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty is complimentary. I certainly have had a great deal of
      experience. My life has no doubt been a long one, but I have made it
      longer by never losing a moment. I was born, too, at a great crisis in
      affairs. Everything that took place before the Trojan war passes for
      nothing in the annals of wisdom. That was a great revolution in all
      affairs human and divine, and from that event we must now date all our
      knowledge. Before the Trojan war we used to talk of the rebellion of the
      Titans, but that business now is an old almanac. As for my powers of
      prophecy, believe me, that those who understand the past are very well
      qualified to predict the future. For my success in life, it may be
      principally ascribed to the observance of a simple rule&mdash;I never
      trust anyone, either god or man. I make an exception in favour of the
      goddesses, and especially of your Majesty,&rsquo; added Tiresias, who piqued
      himself on his gallantry.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they were thus conversing, the Queen directed the attention of Manto
      to a mountainous elevation which now began to rise in the distance, and
      which, from the rapidity of the tide and the freshness of the breeze, they
      approached at a swift rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Behold the Stygian mountains,&rsquo; replied Manto. &lsquo;Through their centre runs
      the passage of Night which leads to the regions of Twilight.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have, then, far to travel?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Assuredly it is no easy task to escape from the gloom of Tartarus to the
      sunbeams of Elysium,&rsquo; remarked Tiresias; &lsquo;but the pleasant is generally
      difficult; let us be grateful that in our instance it is not, as usual,
      forbidden.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You say truly; I am sorry to confess how very often it appears to me that
      sin is enjoyment. But see! how awful are these perpendicular heights,
      piercing the descending vapours, with their peaks clothed with dark pines!
      We seem land-locked.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the experienced master of the infernal yacht knew well how to steer
      his charge through the intricate windings of the river, which here, though
      deep and navigable, became as wild and narrow as a mountain stream; and,
      as the tide no longer served them, and the wind, from their involved
      course, was as often against them as in their favour, the crew were
      obliged to have recourse to their oars, and rowed along until they arrived
      at the mouth of an enormous cavern, from which the rapid stream apparently
      issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am frightened out of my wits,&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine. &lsquo;Surely this
      cannot be our course?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hold, from your Majesty&rsquo;s exclamation,&rsquo; said Tiresias, &lsquo;that we have
      arrived at the passage of Night. When we have proceeded some hundred
      yards, we shall reach the adamantine portals. I pray your Majesty be not
      alarmed. I alone have the signet which can force these mystic gates to
      open. I must be stirring myself. What, ho! Manto.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here am I, father. Hast thou the seal?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In my breast. I would not trust it to my secretaries. They have my
      portfolios full of secret despatches, written on purpose to deceive them;
      for I know that they are spies in the pay of Minerva; but your Majesty
      perceives, with a little prudence, that even a traitor may be turned to
      account.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, Tiresias, leaning on Manto, hobbled to the poop of the
      vessel, and exclaiming aloud, &lsquo;Behold the mighty seal of Dis, whereon is
      inscribed the word the Titans fear,&rsquo; the gates immediately flew open,
      revealing the gigantic form of the Titan Porphyrin, whose head touched the
      vault of the mighty cavern, although he was up to his waist in the waters
      of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, my noble Porphyrion,&rsquo; said Tiresias, &lsquo;bestir thyself, I beseech
      thee. I have brought thee a Queen. Guide her Majesty, I entreat thee, with
      safety through this awful passage of Night.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a horrible creature,&rsquo; whispered Proserpine. &lsquo;I wonder you address
      him with such courtesy.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am always courteous,&rsquo; replied Tiresias. &lsquo;How know I that the Titans may
      not yet regain their lost heritage? They are terrible fellows; and ugly or
      not, I have no doubt that even your Majesty would not find them so
      ill-favoured were they seated in the halls of Olympus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in that,&rsquo; replied Proserpine. &lsquo;I almost wish I were
      once more in Tartarus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Titan Porphyrion in the meantime had fastened a chain-cable to the
      vessel, which he placed over his shoulder, and turning his back to the
      crew, then wading through the waters, he dragged on the vessel in its
      course. The cavern widened, the waters spread. To the joy of Proserpine,
      apparently, she once more beheld the moon and stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bright crescent of Diana!&rsquo; exclaimed the enraptured Queen, &lsquo;and ye too,
      sweet stars, that I have so often watched on the Sicilian plains; do I,
      then, indeed again behold you? or is it only some exquisite vision that
      entrances my being? for, indeed, I do not feel the freshness of that
      breeze that was wont to renovate my languid frame; nor does the odorous
      scent of flowers wafted from the shores delight my jaded senses. What is
      it? Is it life or death; earth, indeed, or Hell?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis nothing,&rsquo; said Tiresias, &lsquo;but a great toy. You must know that Saturn&mdash;until
      at length, wearied by his ruinous experiments, the gods expelled him his
      empire&mdash;was a great dabbler in systems. He was always for making
      moons brighter than Diana, and lighting the stars by gas; but his systems
      never worked. The tides rebelled against their mistress, and the stars
      went out with a horrible stench. This is one of his creations, the most
      ingenious, though a failure. Jove made it a present to Pluto, who is quite
      proud of having a sun and stars of his own, and reckons it among the
      choice treasures of his kingdoms.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Saturn! I pity him; he meant well.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very true. He is the paviour of
      the high-street of Hades. But we cannot afford kings, and especially Gods,
      to be philosophers. The certainty of misrule is better than the chance of
      good government; uncertainty makes people restless.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel very restless myself; I wish we were in Elysium!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The river again narrows!&rsquo; exclaimed Manto. &lsquo;There is no other portal to
      pass. The Saturnian moon and stars grow fainter, there is a grey tint
      expanding in the distance; &lsquo;tis the realm of Twilight; your Majesty will
      soon disembark.&rsquo;

<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Containing an Account of Tiresias at His Rubber</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      TRAVELLERS who have left their homes generally grow mournful as the
      evening draws on; nor is there, perhaps, any time at which the pensive
      influence of twilight is more predominant than on the eve that follows a
      separation from those we love. Imagine, then, the feelings of the Queen of
      Hell, as her barque entered the very region of that mystic light, and the
      shadowy shores of the realm of Twilight opened before her. Her thoughts
      reverted to Pluto; and she mused over all his fondness, all his adoration,
      and all his indulgence, and the infinite solicitude of his affectionate
      heart, until the tears trickled down her beautiful cheeks, and she
      marvelled she ever could have quitted the arms of her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty,&rsquo; observed Manto, who had been whispering to Tiresias,
      &lsquo;feels, perhaps, a little wearied?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By no means, my kind Manto,&rsquo; replied Proserpine, starting from her
      reverie. &lsquo;But the truth is, my spirits are unequal; and though I really
      cannot well fix upon the cause of their present depression, I am
      apparently not free from the contagion of the surrounding gloom.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the evening air,&rsquo; said Tiresias. &lsquo;Your Majesty had perhaps better
      re-enter the pavilion of the yacht. As for myself, I never venture about
      after sunset. One grows romantic. Night was evidently made for in-door
      nature. I propose a rubber.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      To this popular suggestion Proserpine was pleased to accede, and herself
      and Tiresias, Manto and the captain of the yacht, were soon engaged at the
      proposed amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tiresias loved a rubber. It was true he was blind, but then, being a
      prophet, that did not signify. Tiresias, I say, loved a rubber, and was a
      first-rate player, though, perhaps, given a little too much to <i>finesse</i>.
      Indeed, he so much enjoyed taking in his fellow-creatures, that he
      sometimes could not resist deceiving his own partner. Whist is a game
      which requires no ordinary combination of qualities; at the same time,
      memory and invention, a daring fancy, and a cool head. To a mind like that
      of Tiresias, a pack of cards was full of human nature. A rubber was a
      microcosm; and he ruffed his adversary&rsquo;s king, or brought in a long suit
      of his own with as much dexterity and as much enjoyment as, in the real
      business of existence, he dethroned a monarch, or introduced a dynasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will your Majesty be pleased to draw your card?&rsquo; requested the sage. &lsquo;If
      I might venture to offer your Majesty a hint, I would dare to recommend
      your Majesty not to play before your turn. My friends are fond of
      ascribing my success in my various missions to the possession of peculiar
      qualities. No such thing: I owe everything to the simple habit of always
      waiting till it is my turn to speak. And believe me, that he who plays
      before his turn at whist, commits as great a blunder as he who speaks
      before his turn during a negotiation.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The trick, and two by honours,&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;Pray, my dear Tiresias,
      you who are such a fine player, how came you to trump my best card?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I wanted the lead. And those who want to lead, please your
      Majesty, must never hesitate about sacrificing their friends.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you speak truly. I was right in playing that thirteenth card?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite so. Above all things, I love a thirteenth card. I send it forth,
      like a mock project in a revolution, to try the strength of parties.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should not have forced me, Lady Manto,&rsquo; said the Captain of the
      yacht, in a grumbling tone, to his partner. &lsquo;By weakening me, you
      prevented me bringing in my spades. We might have made the game.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should not have been forced,&rsquo; said Tiresias. &lsquo;If she made a mistake,
      who was unacquainted with your plans, what a terrible blunder you
      committed to share her error without her ignorance!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, then, was I to lose a trick?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next to knowing when to seize an opportunity,&rsquo; replied Tiresias, &lsquo;the
      most important thing in life is to know when to forego an advantage.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have cut you an honour, sir,&rsquo; said Manto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which reminds me,&rsquo; replied Tiresias, &lsquo;that, in the last hand, your
      Majesty unfortunately forgot to lead through your adversary&rsquo;s ace. I have
      often observed that nothing ever perplexes an adversary so much as an
      appeal to his honour.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not forget to follow your advice,&rsquo; said the Captain of the yacht,
      playing accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By which you have lost the game,&rsquo; quietly remarked Tiresias. &lsquo;There are
      exceptions to all rules, but it seldom answers to follow the advice of an
      opponent.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Confusion!&rsquo; exclaimed the Captain of the yacht.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Four by honours, and the trick, I declare,&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;I was so
      glad to see you turn up the queen, Tiresias.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I also, madam. Without doubt there are few cards better than her royal
      consort, or, still more, the imperial ace. Nevertheless, I must confess, I
      am perfectly satisfied whenever I remember that I have the Queen on my
      side.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Proserpine bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a good mind to do it, Tiresias,&rsquo; said Queen Proserpine, as that
      worthy sage paid his compliments to her at her toilet, at an hour which
      should have been noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be a great compliment,&rsquo; said Tiresias.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is not much out of our way?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By no means,&rsquo; replied the seer. &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis an agreeable half-way house. He
      lives in good style.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And whence can a dethroned monarch gain a revenue?&rsquo; inquired the Queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your Majesty, I see, is not at all learned in politics. A sovereign never
      knows what an easy income is till he has abdicated. He generally commences
      squabbling with his subjects about the supplies; he is then expelled, and
      voted, as compensation, an amount about double the sum which was the cause
      of the original quarrel.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think, Manto?&rsquo; said Proserpine, as that lady entered the
      cabin; &lsquo;we propose paying a visit to Saturn. He has fixed his residence,
      you know, in these regions of twilight.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I love a junket,&rsquo; replied Manto, &lsquo;above all things. And, indeed, I was
      half frightened out of my wits at the bare idea of toiling over this
      desert. All is prepared, please your Majesty, for our landing. Your
      Majesty&rsquo;s litter is quite ready.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis well,&rsquo; said Proserpine; and leaning on the arm of Manto, the Queen
      came upon deck, and surveyed the surrounding country, a vast grey flat,
      with a cloudless sky of the same tint: in the distance some lowering
      shadows, which seemed like clouds but were in fact mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some half-dozen hours,&rsquo; said Tiresias, &lsquo;will bring us to the palace of
      Saturn. We shall arrive for dinner; the right hour. Let me recommend your
      Majesty to order the curtains of your litter to be drawn, and, if
      possible, to resume your dreams.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They were not pleasant,&rsquo; said Proserpine, &lsquo;I dreamt of my mother and the
      Parc√¶. Manto, methinks I&rsquo;ll read. Hast thou some book?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is a poem, Madam, but I fear it may induce those very slumbers you
      dread.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How call you it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;The Pleasures of Oblivion.&rdquo; The poet apparently is fond of his subject.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And is, I have no doubt, equal to it. Hast any prose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An historical novel or so.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! if you mean those things as full of costume as a fancy ball, and
      almost as devoid of sense, I&rsquo;ll have none of them. Close the curtains;
      even visions of the Furies are preferable to these insipidities.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The halt of the litter roused the Queen from her slumbers. &lsquo;We have
      arrived,&rsquo; said Manto, as she assisted in withdrawing the curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The train had halted before a vast propylon of rose-coloured granite. The
      gate was nearly two hundred feet in height, and the sides of the propylon,
      which rose like huge moles, were sculptured with colossal figures of a
      threatening aspect. Passing through the propylon, the Queen of Hell and
      her attendants entered an avenue in length about three-quarters of a mile,
      formed of colossal figures of the same character and substance,
      alternately raising in their arms javelins or battle-axes, as if about to
      strike. At the end of this heroic avenue appeared the palace of Saturn.
      Ascending a hundred steps of black marble, you stood before a portico
      supported by twenty columns of the same material and shading a single
      portal of bronze. Apparently the palace formed an immense quadrangle; a
      vast tower rising from each corner, and springing from the centre a huge
      and hooded dome. A crowd of attendants, in grey and sad-coloured raiment,
      issued from the portal of the palace at the approach of Proserpine, who
      remarked with strange surprise their singular countenances and demeanour;
      for rare in this silent assemblage was any visage resembling aught she had
      seen, human or divine. Some bore the heads of bats; of owls and beetles
      others; some fluttered moth-like wings, while the shoulders of other
      bipeds were surmounted, in spite of their human organisation, with the
      heads of rats and weasels, of marten-cats and of foxes. But they were all
      remarkably civil; and Proserpine, who was now used to wonders, did not
      shriek at all, and scarcely shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen of Hell was ushered through a superb hall, and down a splendid
      gallery, to a suite of apartments where a body of damsels of a most
      distinguished appearance awaited her. Their heads resembled those of the
      most eagerly-sought, highly-prized, and oftenest-stolen lap-dogs. Upon the
      shoulders of one was the visage of the smallest and most thorough-bred
      little Blenheim in the world. Upon her front was a white star, her nose
      was nearly flat, and her ears were tied under her chin, with the most
      jaunty air imaginable. She was an evident flirt; and a solemn prude of a
      spaniel, with a black and tan countenance, who seemed a sort of duenna,
      evidently watched her with no little distrust. The admirers of blonde
      beauties would, however, have fallen in love with a poodle, with the
      finest head of hair imaginable, and most voluptuous shoulders. This
      brilliant band began barking in the most insinuating tone on the
      appearance of the Queen; and Manto, who was almost as dexterous a linguist
      as Tiresias himself, informed her Majesty that these were the ladies of
      her bed-chamber; upon which Proserpine, who, it will be remembered had no
      passion for dogs, ordered them immediately out of her room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a droll place!&rsquo; exclaimed the Queen. &lsquo;Do you know, we are later than
      I imagined? A hasty toilet to-day; I long to see Saturn. It is droll, I am
      hungry. My purple velvet, I think; it may be considered a compliment. No
      diamonds, only jet; a pearl or two, perhaps. Didst ever see the King?
    </p>
    <p>
      They say he is gentlemanlike, though a bigot. No! no rouge to-day; this
      paleness is quite <i>apropos</i>. Were I as radiant as usual, I should be
      taken for Aurora.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So leaning on Manto, and preceded by the ladies of her bed-chamber, whom,
      notwithstanding their repulse, she found in due attendance in the
      antechamber, Proserpine again continued her progress down the gallery,
      until they stopped at a door, which opening, she was ushered into the
      grand circular saloon, crowned by the dome, whose exterior the Queen had
      already observed. The interior of this apartment was entirely of black and
      grey marble, with the exception of the dome itself, which was of ebony,
      richly carved and supported by more than a hundred columns. There depended
      from the centre of the arch a single chandelier of frosted silver, which
      was itself as big as an ordinary chamber, but of the most elegant form,
      and delicate and fantastic workmanship. As the Queen entered the saloon, a
      personage of venerable appearance, dressed in a suit of black velvet, and
      leaning on an ivory cane, advanced to salute her. There was no mistaking
      this personage; his manners were at once so courteous and so dignified. He
      was clearly their host; and Proserpine, who was quite charmed with his
      grey locks and his black velvet cap, his truly paternal air, and the
      beneficence of his unstudied smile, could scarcely refrain from bending
      her knee, and pressing her lips to his extended hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am proud that your Majesty has remembered me in my retirement,&rsquo; said
      Saturn, as he led Proserpine to a seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mutual compliments were soon disturbed by the announcement of
      dinner, and Saturn offering his arm to the Queen with an air of politeness
      which belonged to the old school, but which the ladies admire in old men,
      handed Proserpine to the banqueting-room. They were followed by some of
      the principal personages of her Majesty&rsquo;s suite, and a couple of young
      Titans, who enjoyed the posts of aides-de-camp to the ex-King, and whose
      duties consisted of carving at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a most agreeable dinner, and Proserpine was delighted with Saturn,
      who, of course, sat by her side, and paid her every possible attention.
      Saturn, whose manners, as has been observed, were of the old school, loved
      a good story, and told several. His anecdotes, especially of society
      previous to the Trojan war, were highly interesting. There ran through all
      his behaviour, too, a tone of high breeding and of consideration for
      others which was really charming; and Proserpine, who had expected to find
      in her host a gloomy bigot, was quite surprised at the truly liberal
      spirit with which he seemed to consider affairs in general. Indeed this
      unexpected tone made so great an impression upon her, that finding a good
      opportunity after dinner, when they were sipping their coffee apart from
      the rest of the company, she could not refrain from entering into some
      conversation with the ex-King upon the subject, and the conversation ran
      thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know,&rsquo; said Proserpine, &lsquo;that much as I have been pleased and
      surprised during my visit to the realms of twilight, nothing has pleased,
      and I am sure nothing has surprised me more, than to observe the
      remarkably liberal spirit in which your Majesty views the affairs of the
      day.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You give me a title, beautiful Proserpine, to which I have no claim,&rsquo;
      replied Saturn. &lsquo;You forget that I am now only Count Hesperus; I am no
      longer a king, and believe me, I am very glad of it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a pity, my dear sir, that you would not condescend to conform to the
      spirit of the age. For myself, I am quite a reformer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I have understood, beautiful Proserpine, which I confess has a little
      surprised me; for to tell you the truth, I do not consider that reform is
      exactly <i>our</i> trade.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Affairs cannot go on as they used,&rsquo; observed Proserpine, oracularly; &lsquo;we
      must bow to the spirit of the age.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is that?&rsquo; inquired Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not exactly know,&rsquo; replied Proserpine, &lsquo;but one hears of it
      everywhere.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I also heard of it a great deal,&rsquo; replied Saturn, &lsquo;and was also
      recommended to conform to it. Before doing so, however, I thought it as
      well to ascertain its nature, and something also of its strength.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is terribly strong,&rsquo; observed Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you think it will be stronger?&rsquo; inquired the ex-King.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly; every day it is more powerful.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then if, on consideration, we were to deem resistance to it advisable, it
      is surely better to commence the contest at once than to postpone the
      struggle.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is useless to talk of resisting; one must conform.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly should consider resistance useless,&rsquo; replied Saturn, &lsquo;for I
      tried it and failed; but at least one has a chance of success; and yet,
      having resisted this spirit and failed, I should not consider myself in a
      worse plight than you would voluntarily place yourself in by conforming to
      it.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak riddles,&rsquo; said Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be plain, then,&rsquo; replied Saturn, &lsquo;I think you may as well at once give
      up your throne, as conform to this spirit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why so?&rsquo; inquired Proserpine very ingenuously.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; replied Saturn, shrugging up his shoulders, &lsquo;I look upon the
      spirit of the age as a spirit hostile to Kings and gods.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Saturn himself attended his beautiful guest over his
      residence, which Proserpine greatly admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis the work of the Titans,&rsquo; replied the ex-King. &lsquo;There never was a
      party so fond of building palaces.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To speak the truth,&rsquo; said Proserpine, &lsquo;I am a little disappointed that I
      have not had an opportunity, during my visit, of becoming acquainted with
      some of the chiefs of that celebrated party; for, although a Liberal, I am
      a female one, and I like to know every sort of person who is
      distinguished.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The fact is,&rsquo; replied her host, &lsquo;that the party has never recovered from
      the thunderbolt of that scheming knave Jupiter, and do not bear their
      defeat so philosophically as years, perhaps, permit me to do. If we have
      been vanquished by the spirit of the age,&rsquo; continued Saturn, &lsquo;you must
      confess that, in our case, the conqueror did not assume a material form
      very remarkable for its dignity. Had Creation resolved itself into its
      original elements, had Chaos come again, or even old Coelus, the indignity
      might have been endured; but to be baffled by an Olympian <i>juste milieu</i>,
      and to find, after all the clamour, that nothing has been changed save the
      places, is, you will own, somewhat mortifying.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how do you reconcile,&rsquo; inquired the ingenuous Proserpine, &lsquo;the
      success of Jupiter with the character which you ascribed last night to the
      spirit of the age?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, in truth,&rsquo; said Saturn, &lsquo;had I not entirely freed myself from all
      party feeling, I might adduce the success of my perfidious and worthless
      relative as very good demonstration that the spirit of the age is nothing
      better than an <i>ignis fatuus</i>. Nevertheless, we must discriminate.
      Even the success of Jupiter, although he now conducts himself in direct
      opposition to the emancipating principles he at first professed, is no
      less good evidence of their force; for by his professions he rose. And,
      for my part, I consider it a great homage to public opinion to find every
      scoundrel now-a-days professing himself a Liberal.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are candid;&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;I should like very much to see the
      Titans.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My friends are at least consistent,&rsquo; observed Saturn; &lsquo;though certainly
      at present I can say little more for them. Between the despair of one
      section of the party, and the over-sanguine expectations of the other,
      they are at present quite inactive, or move only to ensure fresh rebuffs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see little of them, then?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They keep to themselves: they generally frequent a lonely vale in the
      neighbourhood.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should so like to see them!&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say nothing to Tiresias,&rsquo; said old Saturn, who was half in love with his
      fair friend, &lsquo;and we will steal upon them unperceived.&rsquo; So saying, the god
      struck the earth with his cane, and there instantly sprang forth a
      convenient car, built of curiously carved cedar, and borne by four
      enormous tawny-coloured owls. Seating himself by the side of the delighted
      Proserpine, Saturn commanded the owls to bear them to the Valley of
      Lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twas an easy fly: the chariot soon descended upon the crest of a hill:
      and Saturn and Proserpine, leaving the car, commenced, by a winding path,
      the slight ascent of a superior elevation. Having arrived there, they
      looked down upon a valley, apparently land-locked by black and barren
      mountains of the most strange, although picturesque forms. In the centre
      of the valley was a black pool or tarn, bordered with dark purple flags of
      an immense size, twining and twisting among which might be observed the
      glancing and gliding folds of several white serpents; while crocodiles and
      alligators, and other horrible forms, poked their foul snouts with evident
      delight in a vast mass of black slime, which had, at various times, exuded
      from the lake. A single tree only was to be observed in this desolate
      place, an enormous and blasted cedar, with scarcely a patch of verdure,
      but extending its black and barren branches nearly across the valley.
      Seated on a loosened crag, but leaning against the trunk of the cedar,
      with his arms folded, his mighty eyes fixed on the ground, and his legs
      crossed with that air of complete repose which indicates that their owner
      is in no hurry again to move them, was
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;A form, some granite god we deemed,
     Or king of palmy Nile, colossal shapes
     Such as Syene&rsquo;s rosy quarries yield
     To Memphian art; Horus, Osiris called,
     Or Amenoph, who, on the Theban plain,
     With magic melody the sun salutes;
     Or he, far mightier, to whose conquering car
     Monarchs were yoked, Rameses: by the Greeks
     Sesostris styled.    And yet no sculptor&rsquo;s art
     Moulded this shape, for form it seemed of flesh,
     Yet motionless; its dim unlustrous orbs
     Gazing in stilly vacancy, its cheek
     Grey  as its hairs, which, thin as they might seem,
     No breath disturbed; a solemn countenance,
     Not sorrowful, though full of woe sublime,
     As if despair were now a distant dream
     Too dim for memory.&rsquo;
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis their great leader,&rsquo; said Saturn, as he pointed out the Titan to
      Proserpine, &lsquo;the giant Enceladus. He got us into all our scrapes, but I
      must do him the justice to add, that he is the only one who can ever get
      us out of them. They say he has no heart; but I think his hook nose is
      rather fine.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Superb!&rsquo; said Proserpine. &lsquo;And who is that radiant and golden-haired
      youth who is seated at his feet?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis no less a personage than Hyperion himself,&rsquo; replied Saturn, &lsquo;the
      favourite counsellor of Enceladus. He is a fine orator, and makes up by
      his round sentences and choice phrases for the rhetorical deficiencies of
      his chief, who, to speak the truth, is somewhat curt and husky. They have
      enough now to do to manage their comrades and keep a semblance of
      discipline in their routed ranks. Mark that ferocious Briareus there
      scowling in a corner! Didst ever see such a moustache! He glances,
      methinks, with an evil eye on the mighty Enceladus; and, let me tell you,
      Briareus has a great following among them; so they say of him you know,
      that he hath fifty heads and a hundred arms. See! how they gather around
      him.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who speaks now to Briareus?&rsquo; &lsquo;The young and valiant Mimas. Be assured he
      is counselling war. We shall have a debate now.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yon venerable personage, who is seated by the margin of the pool, and
      weeping with the crocodiles&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is old Oceanus.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is apparently much affected by his overthrow.&rsquo; &lsquo;It is his wont to
      weep. He used to cry when he fought, and yet he was a powerful warrior.&rsquo;
      &lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; said Proserpine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The awful voice of Briareus broke the silence. What a terrible personage
      was Briareus! His wild locks hung loose about his shoulders, and blended
      with his unshorn beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Titans!&rsquo; shouted the voice which made many a heart tremble, and the
      breathless Proserpine clasp the arm of Saturn. &lsquo;Titans! Is that spirit
      dead that once heaped Ossa upon Pelion? Is it forgotten, even by
      ourselves, that a younger born revels in our heritage? Are these forms
      that surround me, indeed, the shapes at whose dread sight the base
      Olympians fled to their fitting earth? Warriors, whose weapons were the
      rocks, whose firebrands were the burning woods, is the day forgotten when
      Jove himself turned craven, and skulked in Egypt? At least my memory is
      keen enough to support my courage, and whatever the dread Enceladus may
      counsel, my voice is still for war!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      There ensued, after this harangue of Briareus, a profound and thrilling
      silence, which was, however, broken in due time by the great leader of the
      Titans himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mouth it well, Briareus,&rsquo; replied Enceladus calmly. &lsquo;And if great
      words would re-seat us in Olympus, doubtless, with your potent aid, we
      might succeed. It never should be forgotten, however, that had we combined
      at first, in the spirit now recommended, the Olympians would never have
      triumphed; and least of all our party should Briareus and his friends
      forget the reasons of our disunion.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I take thy sneer, Enceladus,&rsquo; said the young and chivalric Mimas, &lsquo;and
      throw it in thy teeth. This learn, then, from Briareus and his friends,
      that if we were lukewarm in the hour of peril, the fault lies not to our
      account, but with those who had previously so conducted themselves, that,
      when the danger arrived, it was impossible for us to distinguish between
      our friends and our foes. Enceladus apparently forgets that had the
      Olympians never been permitted to enter Heaven, it would have been
      unnecessary ever to have combined against their machinations.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Recrimination is useless,&rsquo; said a Titan, interposing. &lsquo;I was one of those
      who supported Enceladus in the admission of the Olympians above, and I
      regret it. But at the time, like others, I believed it to be the only mode
      of silencing the agitation of Jupiter.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I separated from Enceladus on that question,&rsquo; said a huge Titan, lying
      his length on the ground and leaning one arm on a granite crag; &lsquo;but I am
      willing to forget all our differences and support him with all my heart
      and strength in another effort to restore our glorious constitution.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Titans,&rsquo; said Enceladus, &lsquo;who is there among you who has found me a
      laggard in the day of battle?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Olympians, as Briareus thinks it necessary to remind you, fled, I
      was your leader. Remember, however, then, that there were no thunderbolts.
      As for myself, I candidly confess to you, that, since the invention of
      these weapons by Jove, I do not see how war can be carried on by us any
      longer with effect.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the memory of old Coelus and these fast-flowing tears,&rsquo; murmured the
      venerable Oceanus, patting at the same time a crocodile on the back, &lsquo;I
      call you all to witness that I have no interest to deceive you.
      Nevertheless, we should not forget that, in this affair of the
      thunderbolts, it is the universal opinion that there is a very
      considerable reaction. I have myself, only within these few days, received
      authentic information that several have fallen of late without any visible
      ill effects; and I am credibly assured that, during the late storm in
      Thessaly, a thunderbolt was precipitated into the centre of a vineyard,
      without affecting the flavour of a single grape.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      Here several of the Titans, who had gathered round Enceladus, shook their
      heads and shrugged their shoulders, and a long and desultory conversation
      ensued upon the copious and very controversial subject of Re-action. In
      the meantime Rhoetus, a young Titan, whispered to one of his companions,
      that for his part he was convinced that the only way to beat the Olympians
      was to turn them into ridicule; and that he would accordingly commence at
      once with the pasquinade on the private life of Jupiter, and some
      peculiarly delicate criticisms on the characters of the goddesses.

    <h2>
      PART IV.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>Containing the First View of Elysium</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      THE toilsome desert was at length passed, and the royal cavalcade ascended
      the last chasm of mountains that divided Elysium, or the Regions of Bliss,
      from the Realm of Twilight. As she quitted those dim and dreary plains,
      the spirit of Proserpine grew lighter, and she indulged in silent but
      agreeable anticipations of the scene which she was now approaching. On
      reaching, however, the summit of the mountainous chain, and proceeding a
      short distance over the rugged table-land into which it now declined, her
      Majesty was rather alarmed at perceiving that her progress was impeded by
      a shower of flame that extended, on either side, as far as the eye could
      reach. Her alarm, however, was of short continuance; for, on the
      production of his talisman by Tiresias, the shower of flame instantly
      changed into silvery drops of rose-water and other delicious perfumes.
      Amid joyous peals of laughter, and some slight playful screams on the part
      of the ladies, the cavalcade ventured through the ordeal. Now the effect
      of this magical bath was quite marvellous. A burthen seemed suddenly to
      have been removed from the spirits of the whole party; their very
      existence seemed renewed; the blood danced about their veins in the
      liveliest manner imaginable; and a wild but pleasing titillation ran like
      lightning through their nerves, their countenances sparkled with
      excitement; and they all talked at the same time. Proserpine was so
      occupied with her own sensations, that she did not immediately remark the
      extraordinary change that had occurred in the appearance of the country
      immediately on passing this magical barrier. She perceived that their
      course now led over the most elastic and carefully-shaven turf; groups of
      beautiful shrubs occasionally appeared, and she discovered with delight
      that their flowers constantly opened, and sent forth from their bells
      diminutive birds of radiant plumage. Above them, too, the clouds vanished,
      and her head was canopied by a sky, unlike, indeed, all things and tints
      of earth, but which reminded her, in some degree, of the splendour of
      Olympus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Proserpine, restless with delight, quitted her litter, and followed by
      Manto, ran forward to catch the first view of Elysium.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite out of breath,&rsquo; said her Majesty, &lsquo;and really must sit down on
      this bank of violets. Was ever anything in the world so delightful? Why,
      Olympus is nothing to it! And after Tartarus, too, and that poor unhappy
      Saturn, and his Titans and his twilight, it really is too much for me. How
      I do long for the view! and yet, somehow or other, my heart beats so I
      cannot walk.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will your Majesty re-ascend your litter?&rsquo; suggested Manto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! that is worse than anything. They are a mile behind; they are so
      slow. Why, Manto! what is this?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      A beautiful white dove hovered in the air over the head of Proserpine and
      her attendant, and then dropping an olive branch into the lap of the
      Queen, flapped its wings and whirled away. But what an olive branch! the
      stem was of agate; each leaf was an emerald; and on the largest, in
      letters of brilliants, was this inscription:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     <i>The Elysians to Their Beautiful Queen</i>
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is it not superb?&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine. &lsquo;What charming people, and
      what excellent subjects! What loyalty and what taste!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, the enraptured Proserpine rose from the bank of violets, and
      had scarcely run forwards fifty yards when she suddenly stopped, and
      started with an exclamation of wonder. The table-land had ceased. She
      stood upon a precipice of white marble, in many parts clothed with thick
      bowers of myrtle; before her extended the wide-spreading plains of
      Elysium. They were bounded upon all sides by gentle elevations entirely
      covered with flowers, and occasionally shooting forward into the champaign
      country; behind these appeared a range of mountains clothed with bright
      green forests, and still loftier heights behind them, exhibiting, indeed,
      only bare and sharply-pointed peaks glittering with prismatic light. The
      undulating plain was studded in all directions with pavilions and
      pleasure-houses, and groves and gardens glowing with the choicest and most
      charming fruit; and a broad blue river wound through it, covered with
      brilliant boats, the waters flashing with phosphoric light as they were
      cut by the swift and gliding keels. And in the centre of the plain rose a
      city, a mighty group of all that was beautiful in form and costly in
      materials, bridges and palaces and triumphal gates of cedar and of marble,
      columns and minarets of gold, and cupolas and domes of ivory; and ever and
      anon appeared delicious gardens, raised on the terraces of the houses; and
      groups of palm trees with their tall, thin stems, and quivering and
      languid crests, rose amid the splendid masonry. A sweet soft breeze
      touched the cheek of the entranced Proserpine, and a single star of silver
      light glittered in the rosy sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&lsquo;Tis my favourite hour,&rsquo; exclaimed Proserpine. &lsquo;Thus have I gazed upon
      Hesperus in the meads of Enna! What a scene! How fortunate that we should
      have arrived at sunset!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Madam!&rsquo; observed Manto, &lsquo;in Elysium the sky is ever thus. For the
      Elysians, the sun seems always to have just set!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fortunate people!&rsquo; replied Proserpine. &lsquo;In them, immortality and
      enjoyment seem indeed blended together. A strange feeling, half of
      languor, half of voluptuousness, steals over my senses! It seems that I at
      length behold the region of my girlish dreams. Such once I fancied
      Olympus. Ah! why does not my Pluto live in Elysium?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The Elysians consisted of a few thousand beatified mortals, the only
      occupation of whose existence was enjoyment; the rest of the population
      comprised some millions of Gnomes and Sylphs, who did nothing but work,
      and ensured by their labour the felicity of the superior class. Every
      Elysian, male or female, possessed a magnificent palace in the city, and
      an elegant pavilion on the plain; these, with a due proportion of
      chariots, horses, and slaves, constituted a proper establishment. The
      Sylphs and the Gnomes were either scattered about the country, which they
      cultivated, or lived in the city, where they kept shops, and where they
      emulated each other in displaying the most ingenious articles of luxury
      and convenience for the enjoyment and accommodation of the Elysians. The
      townspeople, indeed, rather affected to look down upon the more
      simple-minded agriculturists; but if these occasionally felt a little
      mortification in consequence, they might have been consoled, had they been
      aware that their brethren and sisters who were in the service of the
      Elysians avenged their insults, for these latter were the finest Gnomes
      and Sylphs imaginable, and scarcely deigned to notice any one who was in
      trade. Whether there were any coin or other circulating medium current in
      Elysium is a point respecting which I must confess I have not sufficient
      information to decide; but if so, it certainly would appear that all money
      transactions were confined to the Gnomes and the Sylphs, for the Elysians
      certainly never paid for anything. Perhaps this exemption might have been
      among their peculiar privileges, and was a substitute for what we call
      credit, a convenience of which the ancients appear to have had a limited
      conception. The invention, by Jupiter, of an aristocratic immortality, as
      a reward for a well-spent life on earth, appears to have been an ingenious
      idea. It really is a reward, very stimulative of good conduct before we
      shuffle off the mortal coil, and remarkably contrasts with the democracy
      of the damned. The Elysians, with a splendid climate, a teeming soil, and
      a nation made on purpose to wait upon them, of course enjoyed themselves
      very much. The arts flourished, the theatres paid, and they had a much
      finer opera than at Ephesus or at Halicarnassus. Their cookery was so
      refined, that one of the least sentimental ceremonies in the world was not
      only deprived of all its grossness, but was actually converted into an
      elegant amusement, and so famous that their artists were even required at
      Olympus. If their dinners were admirable, which is rare, their assemblies
      were amusing, which is still more uncommon. All the arts of society were
      carried to perfection in Elysium; a dull thing was never said, and an
      awkward thing never done. The Elysians, indeed, being highly refined and
      gifted, for they comprised in their order the very cream of terrestrial
      society, were naturally a liberal-minded race of nobles, and capable of
      appreciating every kind of excellence. If a Gnome or a Sylph, therefore,
      in any way distinguished themselves; if they sang very well, or acted very
      well, or if they were at all eminent for any of the other arts of
      amusement, ay! indeed if the poor devils could do nothing better than
      write a poem or a novel, they were sure to be noticed by the Elysians, who
      always bowed to them as they passed by, and sometimes indeed even admitted
      them into their circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the train of Proserpine rejoined her on the brink of the
      precipice, than they heard the flourish of trumpets near at hand, soon
      followed by a complete harmony of many instruments. A chorus of sweet
      voices was next distinguished, growing each instant more loud and clear;
      and in a few minutes, issuing from a neighbouring grove, came forth a band
      of heroes and beautiful women, dressed in dazzling raiment, to greet the
      Queen. A troop of chariots of light and airy workmanship followed, and a
      crowd of Gnomes and Sylphs singing and playing on various instruments, and
      dancing with gestures of grace and delicacy. Congratulating the Queen on
      her arrival in Elysium, and requesting the honour of being permitted to
      attend her to her palace, they ushered Proserpine and her companions to
      the chariots, and soon, winding down a gradual declivity, they entered the
      plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the capital had enchanted Proserpine, the
      agreeable impression was not diminished, as is generally the case, by her
      entrance into the city. Never were so much splendour and neatness before
      combined. Passing through a magnificent arch, Proserpine entered a street
      of vast and beautiful proportions, lined on each side with palaces of
      various architecture, painted admirably in fresco, and richly gilt. The
      road was formed of pounded marbles of various colours, laid down in
      fanciful patterns, and forming an unrivalled mosaic; it was bounded on
      each side by a broad causeway of jasper, of a remarkably bright green,
      clouded with milk-white streaks. This street led to a sumptuous square,
      forming alone the palace destined for Proserpine. Its several fronts were
      supported and adorned by ten thousand columns, imitating the palm and the
      lotus; nor is it possible to conceive anything more light and graceful
      than the general effect of this stupendous building. Each front was
      crowned with an immense dome of alabaster, so transparent, that when the
      palace was illuminated the rosy heaven grew pale, and an effect similar to
      moonlight was diffused over the canopy of Elysium. And in the centre of
      the square a Leviathan, carved in white coral, and apparently flouncing in
      a huge basin of rock crystal, spouted forth from his gills a fountain
      twelve hundred feet in height; from one gill ascended a stream of
      delicious wine, which might be tempered, if necessary, by the iced water
      that issued from the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the approach of the Queen, the gigantic gates of the palace, framed of
      carved cedar, flew open with a thrilling burst of music, and Proserpine
      found herself in a hall wherein several hundred persons, who formed her
      household, knelt in stillness before her. Wearied with her long journey,
      and all the excitement of the day, Proserpine signified to one of the
      Elysians in attendance her desire for refreshment and repose. Immediately
      the household rose, and gracefully bowing retired in silence, while four
      ladies of the bed-chamber, very different from the dogfaced damsels of the
      realm of Twilight, advanced with a gracious smile, and each pressing a
      white hand to her heart, invited her Majesty to accompany them. Twelve
      beautiful pages in fanciful costume, and each bearing a torch of cinnamon,
      preceded them, and Proserpine ascended a staircase of turquoise and
      silver. As she passed along, she caught glimpses of costly galleries, and
      suites of gorgeous chambers, but she was almost too fatigued to
      distinguish anything. A confused vision of long lines of white columns,
      roofs of carved cedar, or ceilings glowing with forms of exquisite beauty,
      walls covered with lifelike tapestry, or reflecting in their mighty
      mirrors her own hurrying figure, and her picturesque attendants, alone
      remained. She rejoiced when she at length arrived in a small chamber, in
      which preparations evidently denoted that it was intended she should rest.
      It was a pretty little saloon, brilliantly illuminated, and hung with
      tapestry depicting a party of nymphs and shepherds feasting in an Arcadian
      scene. In the middle of the chamber a banquet was prepared, and as
      Proserpine seated herself, and partook of some of the delicacies which a
      page immediately presented to her, there arose, from invisible musicians,
      a joyous and festive strain, which accompanied her throughout her repast.
      When her Majesty had sufficiently refreshed herself, and as the banquet
      was removing, the music assumed a softer and more subduing, occasionally
      even a solemn tone; the tapestry, slowly shifting, at length represented
      the same characters sunk in repose; the attendants all this time gradually
      extinguishing the lights, and stealing on tiptoe from the chamber. So
      that, at last, the music, each moment growing fainter, entirely ceased;
      the figures on the tapestry were scarcely perceptible by the dim lustre of
      a single remaining lamp; and the slumbering Proserpine fell back upon her
      couch.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Queen of Hell was not destined to undisturbed repose. A dream
      descended on her brain, and the dream was terrible and strange. She beheld
      herself a child, playing, as was her wont, in the gardens of Enna, twining
      garlands of roses, and chasing butterflies. Suddenly, from a bosky thicket
      of myrtle, slowly issued forth an immense serpent, dark as night, but with
      eyes of the most brilliant tint, and approached the daughter of Ceres. The
      innocent child, ignorant of evil, beheld the monster without alarm. Not
      only did she neither fly nor shriek, but she even welcomed and caressed
      the frightful stranger, patted its voluminous back, and admired its
      sparkling vision. The serpent, fascinated instead of fascinating, licked
      her feet with his arrowy tongue, and glided about for her diversion in a
      thousand shapes. Emboldened by its gentleness, the little Proserpine at
      length even mounted on its back, and rode in triumph among her bowers.
      Every day the dark serpent issued from the thicket, and every day he found
      a welcome playmate. Now it come to pass that one day the serpent, growing
      more bold, induced the young Proserpine to extend her ride beyond the
      limits of Enna. Night came on, and as it was too late to return, the
      serpent carried her to a large cave, where it made for her a couch of
      leaves, and while she slept the affectionate monster kept guard for her
      protection at the mouth of the cavern. For some reason or other which was
      not apparent, for in dreams there are always some effects without causes,
      Proserpine never returned to Enna, but remained and resided with
      cheerfulness in this cavern. Each morning the serpent went forth alone to
      seek food for its charge, and regularly returned with a bough in its mouth
      laden with delicious fruits. One day, during the absence of her guardian,
      a desire seized Proserpine to quit the cavern, and accordingly she went
      forth. The fresh air and fragrance of the earth were delightful to her,
      and she roamed about, unconscious of time, and thoughtless of her return.
      And as she sauntered along, singing to herself, a beautiful white dove,
      even the same dove that had welcomed her in the morning on the heights of
      Elysium, flew before her with its wings glancing in the sunshine. It
      seemed that the bird wished to attract the attention of the child, so long
      and so closely did it hover about her; now resting on a branch, as if
      inviting capture, and then skimming away only to return more swiftly; and
      occasionally, when for a moment unnoticed, even slightly flapping the
      rambler with its plume. At length the child was taken with a fancy to
      catch the bird. But no sooner had she evinced this desire, than the bird,
      once apparently so anxious to be noticed, seemed resolved to lead her a
      weary chase; and hours flew away ere Proserpine, panting and exhausted,
      had captured the beautiful rover and pressed it to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, indeed, a most beautiful bird, and its possession repaid her for
      all her exertions. But lo! as she stood, in a wild sylvan scene caressing
      it, smoothing its soft plumage, and pressing its head to her cheek, she
      beheld in the distance approaching her the serpent, and she beheld her old
      friend with alarm. Apparently her misgiving was not without cause. She
      observed in an instant that the appearance and demeanour of the serpent
      were greatly changed. It approached her swift as an arrow, its body
      rolling in the most agitated contortions, its jaws were distended as if to
      devour her, its eyes flashed fire, its tongue was a forked flame, and its
      hiss was like a stormy wind. Proserpine shrieked, and the Queen of Hell
      awoke from her dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Elysian world called to pay their respects to
      Proserpine. Her Majesty, indeed, held a drawing-room, which was fully and
      brilliantly attended. Her beauty and her graciousness were universally
      pronounced enchanting. From this moment the career of Proserpine was a
      series of magnificent entertainments. The principal Elysians vied with
      each other in the splendour and variety of the amusements, which they
      offered to the notice of their Queen. Operas, plays, balls, and banquets
      followed in dazzling succession. Proserpine, who was almost inexperienced
      in society, was quite fascinated. She regretted the years she had wasted
      in her Sicilian solitude; she marvelled that she ever could have looked
      forward with delight to a dull annual visit to Olympus; she almost
      regretted that, for the sake of an establishment, she could have been
      induced to cast her lot in the regal gloom of Tartarus. Elysium exactly
      suited her. The beauty of the climate and the country, the total absence
      of care, the constant presence of amusement, the luxury, gaiety, and
      refined enjoyment perfectly accorded with her amiable disposition, her
      lively fancy and her joyous temper. She drank deep and eagerly of the cup
      of pleasure. She entered into all the gay pursuits of her subjects; she
      even invented new combinations of diversion. Under her inspiring rule
      every one confessed that Elysium became every day more Elysian. The
      manners of her companions greatly pleased her. She loved those faces
      always wreathed with smiles, yet never bursting into laughter. She was
      charmed at the amiable tone in which they addressed each other. Never
      apparently were people at the same time so agreeable, so obliging, and so
      polished. For in all they said and did might be detected that peculiar air
      of high-breeding which pervades the whole conduct of existence with a
      certain indefinable spirit of calmness, so that your nerves are never
      shaken by too intense an emotion, which eventually produces a painful
      reaction. Whatever they did, the Elysians were careful never to be
      vehement; a grand passion, indeed, was unknown in these happy regions;
      love assumed the milder form of flirtation; and as for enmity, you were
      never abused except behind your back, or it exuded itself in an epigram,
      or, at the worst, a caricature scribbled upon a fan.
    </p>

      There is one characteristic of the Elysians which, in justice to them, I
      ought not to have omitted. They were eminently a moral people. If a lady
      committed herself, she was lost for ever, and packed off immediately to
      the realm of Twilight. Indeed, they were so particular, that the moment
      one of the softer sex gave the slightest symptoms of preference to a
      fortunate admirer, the Elysian world immediately began to look unutterable
      things, shrug its moral shoulders, and elevate its charitable eyebrows.
      But if the preference, by any unlucky chance, assumed the nobler aspect of
      devotion, and the unhappy fair one gave any indication of really
      possessing a heart, rest assured she was already half way on the road to
      perdition. Then commenced one of the most curious processes imaginable,
      peculiar I apprehend to Elysium, but which I record that the society of
      less fortunate lands may avail itself of the advantage, and adopt the
      regulation in its moral police. Immediately that it was clearly
      ascertained that two persons of different sexes took an irrational
      interest in each other&rsquo;s society, all the world instantly went about,
      actuated by a purely charitable sentiment, telling the most extraordinary
      falsehoods concerning them that they could devise. Thus it was the fashion
      to call at one house and announce that you had detected the unhappy pair
      in a private box at the theatre, and immediately to pay your respects at
      another mansion and declare that you had observed them on the very same
      day, and at the very same hour, in a boat on the river. At the next visit,
      the gentleman had been discovered driving her in his cab; and in the
      course of the morning the scene of indiscretion was the Park, where they
      had been watched walking by moonlight, muffled up in sables and cashmeres.
    </p>
    <p>
      This curious process of diffusing information was known in Elysium under
      the title of <i>&lsquo;being talked about;</i>&rsquo; and although the stories thus
      disseminated were universally understood to be fictions, the Elysians
      ascribed great virtue to the proceeding, maintaining that many an
      indiscreet fair one had been providentially alarmed by thus becoming the
      subject of universal conversation; that thus many a reputation had been
      saved by this charitable slander. There were some malignant philosophers,
      indeed, doubtless from that silly love of paradox in all ages too
      prevalent, who pretended that all this Elysian morality was one great
      delusion, and that this scrupulous anxiety about the conduct of others
      arose from a principle, not of <i>Purity</i>, but of <i>Corruption</i>.
      The woman who is &lsquo;talked about,&rsquo; these sages would affirm, is generally
      virtuous, and she is only abused because she devotes to one the charms
      which all wish to enjoy.

    <p>
      Thus Dido, who is really one of the finest creatures that ever existed,
      and who with a majestic beauty combines an heroic soul, has made her way
      with difficulty to the Elysian circle, to which her charms and rank
      entitle her; while Helen, who, from her very <i>d√©but</i>, has been
      surrounded by fifty lovers, and whose intrigues have ever been notorious,
      is the very queen of fashion; and all this merely because she has favoured
      fifty instead of one, and in the midst of all her scrapes has contrived to
      retain the countenance of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apropos of Dido, the Queen of Carthage was the person in all Elysium for
      whom Proserpine took the greatest liking. Exceedingly beautiful, with the
      most generous temper and the softest heart in the world, and blessed by
      nature with a graceful simplicity of manner, which fashion had never
      sullied, it really was impossible to gaze upon the extraordinary
      brilliancy of her radiant countenance, to watch the symmetry of her superb
      figure, and to listen to the artless yet lively observations uttered by a
      voice musical as a bell, without being fairly bewitched.

    <p>
      When we first enter society, we are everywhere; yet there are few, I
      imagine, who, after a season, do not subside into a coterie. When the
      glare of saloons has ceased to dazzle, and we are wearied with the
      heartless notice of a crowd, we require refinement and sympathy. We find
      them, and we sink into a clique. And after all, can the river of life flow
      on more agreeably than in a sweet course of pleasure with those we love?
      To wander in the green shade of secret woods and whisper our affection; to
      float on the sunny waters of some gentle stream, and listen to a serenade;
      to canter with a light-hearted cavalcade over breezy downs, or cool our
      panting chargers in the summer stillness of winding and woody lanes; to
      banquet with the beautiful and the witty; to send care to the devil, and
      indulge the whim of the moment; the priest, the warrior and the statesman
      may frown and struggle as they like; but this is existence, and this, this
      is Elysium!
    </p>
    <p>
      So Proserpine deemed when, wearied with the monotony of the great world,
      she sought refuge in the society of Dido and Atalanta, Achilles, Amphion,
      and Patroclus or Memnon. When √Üneas found that Dido had become
      fashionable, he made overtures for a reconciliation, but Dido treated him
      with calm contempt. The pious √Üneas, indeed, was the aversion of
      Proserpine. He was the head of the Elysian saints, was president of a
      society to induce the Gnomes only to drink water, and was so horrified at
      the general conduct of the Elysians, that he questioned the decrees of
      Minos and Rhadamanthus, who had permitted them to enter the happy region
      so easily. The pious √Üneas was of opinion that everybody ought to have
      been damned except himself. Proserpine gave him no encouragement. Achilles
      was the finest gentleman in Elysium. No one dressed or rode like him. He
      was very handsome, very witty, very unaffected, and had an excellent
      heart. Achilles was the leader of the Elysian youth, who were indeed
      devoted to him: Proserpine took care, therefore, that he should dangle in
      her train. Amphion had a charming voice for a supper after the opera. He
      was a handsome little fellow, but not to be depended upon. He broke a
      heart, or a dinner engagement, with the same reckless sentimentality; for
      he was one of those who always weep when they betray you, and whom you are
      sure never to see again immediately that they have vowed eternal
      friendship. Patroclus was a copy of Achilles without his talents and
      vivacity, but elegant and quiet. Of all these, Memnon was perhaps the
      favourite of Proserpine; nor must he be forgotten; amiable, gay,
      brilliant, the child of whim and impulse, in love with every woman he met
      for four-and-twenty hours, and always marvelling at his own delusion!
